Floating Mountains of Myria
----------------------------

Gravity here is playful.
Stone islands drift on gentle updrafts over a calm valley.
Bridges of rope connect platforms that move a little each hour.
Gliders circle like slow birds.

A wide ledge offers a safe selfie with peaks behind you.
Do not jump between islands without a line.

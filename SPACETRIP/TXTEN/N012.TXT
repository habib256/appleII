Crystal Canyons of Virelia
---------------------------

Tall crystal walls rise like organ pipes.
Wind makes them sing with pure tones.
Shards glitter on the canyon floor.
The air is cool and very clear.

Stand near a safe wall and frame the songs in the back.
Do not touch loose shards with bare hands.

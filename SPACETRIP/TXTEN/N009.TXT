Ring Surf Station, Tethys
--------------------------

A small outpost orbits inside a bright ring band.
Ice blocks drift like silent ships.
Guides steer sleds along stable paths in the ring.
Everything sparkles in raw sunlight.

Pose beside a sled with the ring plane behind you.
Mind the gentle but steady drift of debris.

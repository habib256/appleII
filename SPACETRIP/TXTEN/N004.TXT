Comet Boardwalk
----------------

Here you arrive on a small comet near perihelion.
Jets of gas roar from cracks in the ice.
A secure boardwalk follows the ridge above a bright tail.
The light is harsh and the shadows are sharp.

This is a perfect place for a bold selfie with the tail behind you.
Keep your boots locked to the deck during outgassing bursts.

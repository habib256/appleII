Mirror Sea of Epsilon
----------------------

The ocean here is flat as glass.
Stars reflect so well it feels like flying in space.
Low islands carry black sand and pale towers.
Waves move in slow, long breaths.

A pier offers a perfect selfie that shows two skies.
Step softly to keep the surface smooth.

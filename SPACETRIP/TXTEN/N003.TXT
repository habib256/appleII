Supermassive Black Hole
------------------------

Here you are facing the ultimate cosmic abyss: Sagittarius A*, the
supermassive black hole at the heart of our galaxy! Its dark silhouette
stands majestically against the backdrop of an incandescent accretion disk.
The titanic gravitational forces distort space-time itself.

The spectacle is breathtaking. Be careful, however, not to get too
close to the event horizon, or your selfie might end up stretched
to the end of time!

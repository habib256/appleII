Wormhole Gate of Kalyx
-----------------------

An ancient ring floats above a dim moon.
Cold sparks crawl along its inner rim.
Pilots leave offerings of small metal charms.
The gate hums with a deep, patient note.

Aim your selfie so the ring frames your head.
Do not activate the core without a flight plan.

T 401 The Trap

A trap opens in front of you and you fall into a pit.
When you regain consciousness, you find yourself chained
to a wall by heavy chains. Stratagus stands before you
and smiles at you. His smile, however, is not warm,
and at the sight of what he holds in his hands, you begin
to tremble in all your limbs. Needless to say, your
adventure is over.

T 001 The Path to the Swamp

The journey to the Swamp in the far west of the kingdom has been
long. As you progress, the mountains become hills, then plains, and
finally low, humid lands. You reach Marshville. In the tavern, you
proclaim your intention to explore the Scorpion Swamp. Immediately,
the patrons gather around, worried. "Explore the Swamp? You can't
be serious! Others have been lost there, their bones bleaching in
its depths! The place is crawling with vermin, monsters and bandits.
The Masters, a clan of evil sorcerers, are its lords. One of them,
a brutal giant, came here with two grey wolves. He doesn't like
intruders." The villagers want to hold you back. What do you do?

T 017 The Thief's Strangling
You cross the clearing without paying attention to the man.
The moment you reach the path, a cord wraps around
your neck. You struggle, but the thief strangles you.
You collapse, unconscious, and immediately lose 3
STAMINA points. Upon waking, you feel weak and have
dizziness. All your Stones and other magical items have disappeared.
There is no trace of the thief; you are stripped and abandoned.
What do you do?

T 036 Conversation with the Garden Master
You calmly explain the purpose of your quest to the Garden Master.
He listens to you in a measured voice and gauges your sincerity.
Depending on what you have already discovered, he can guide you.
If you've found the Asphodel bush, he knows what to do.
Otherwise, he will indicate another path or a trail to follow.
What do you do?

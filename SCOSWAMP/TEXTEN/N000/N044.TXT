T 044 The Leeches

No one attacks you as you cross the river,
but, on the other bank, large leeches have attached
themselves to your legs and are sucking your blood. Roll two dice.
Reduce your total STAMINA by the smaller of the two
numbers rolled. In case of a double, you lose the sum
of both dice (i.e. 2 times the indicated value). If you
survive, you can then resume the journey.
Do you want to go north or south?

C 157 Take the path to the north
C 398 Take the path to the south

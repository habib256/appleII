T 003 Scorpion Swamp
You stumble into a hole; both your feet immediately sink into
the mud. You try in vain to free yourself by grabbing a plant,
but its stem breaks and you sink even deeper. Small cries ring
out behind you. You try to grab your sword, but sharp teeth sink
into your hand. A few moments later, dozens of rats assault you.
It's impossible to flee or fight them; the mud holds you from all
sides. Soon, as the villagers had predicted, only a skeleton under
the trees remains of you. Your adventure is over. Next time,
without magic, you won't leave the Scorpion Swamp alive.

T 033 Pincer Grass Again
You hurry to cross the clearing, hoping to escape the plant.
Alas, the grass grows even faster and stands before you in mass.
Pincers open eagerly and seek to seize you from all sides.
You must choose quickly: strike with your sword or use a spell to contain it.
You are in Clearing No. 388.
What do you do?

C 134 Fight the Pincer Grass with sword strokes
C 167 Resort to magic to contain it

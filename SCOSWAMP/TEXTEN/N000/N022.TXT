T 022 Rapid Shoots

As you slip the seeds into your pocket, barely
new shoots already appear at the base of the trees.
They grow with strange speed, wrapping around
the roots and closing the ground behind you. You must
leave as quickly as possible before the trees regain strength.
Which direction will you take? Choose without delay.
North offers a path that rises toward drier lands.
South leads back to the deep river. West presents a
narrow passage, perhaps less dangerous.

C 320 Take the path that climbs to the north
C 090 Join the deep river to the south
C 011 Take the narrow passage to the west

T 018 Frightened Brigands
You charge while brandishing your sword; the brigands are afraid.
All five flee among the trees bordering the clearing.
You don't stop; you cross the clearing running
and shouting. The unarmed brigands don't even think to
pursue you. You leave behind their cries and their flight.

C 019 Reach the road running

T 009 The Swamp Entrance

You are at the southern edge of the Scorpion Swamp. Thanks to
the Copper Ring, you will always know where north is.
You discover a path oriented due north. A few words
painted on a rock warn you: WARNING! SCORPION
SWAMP! TURN BACK! Two crossed shinbones and
a skull add to this threat. You pay no attention.
With an assured gait, you cross the edge. The air becomes
heavier, mud oozes from everywhere. Very quickly,
you understand that it would be foolish to leave the path. The
deceptive ground sucks at your boots. Only way out: follow the path
without ever straying from it. The humidity clings to your skin and
insects swirl in clouds. The Swamp opens before you,
hostile and silent, like a living trap.

C 195 Advance cautiously on the path toward the heart of the Swamp

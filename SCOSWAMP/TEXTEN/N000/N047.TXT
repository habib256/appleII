T 047 Three Grassy Paths
You arrive in a small clearing overgrown with grass. Nothing
interesting appears there at first sight; the air is heavy and calm.
Three paths allow you to leave this clearing: south, east and west.
The south path seems wetter; the east offers a glimpse of horizon;
the west is narrow and bordered by tight trees.
You are in Clearing No. 003.
What do you do?

C 290 Go south
C 031 Take the east path
C 118 Take the west path

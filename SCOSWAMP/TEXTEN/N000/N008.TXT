T 008 Proposed Exchange
Pompatarte sighs and shakes his head: 'It's a shame...'
If you still have some Magic Stones, I'll trade them
for a Healing Potion.' His offer is simple and immediate:
exchange of resources for guaranteed healing.
Weigh the advantage: the potion heals, the stones serve magic.
What do you do?

C 141 Trade the remaining Stones for the Potion
C 316 Say that you've used them all
C 341 Attack Pompatarte

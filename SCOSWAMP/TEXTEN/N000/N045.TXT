T 045 Suspicious Bridge
You distrust this bridge which seems too simple; it must
undoubtedly conceal some trap. So you retrace your
steps in the direction you came from. The route depends on
your origin: return north if you came from the north,
or south if you came from the south.

C 331 Return to the north
C 303 Return to the south

T 029 Useful Lie
You conclude that it would be stupid to reveal that you serve a sorcerer.
You lie: "I serve the forces of Good. For now I'm only seeking
the way out of the Swamp; I'm looking for one of the Masters."
Test your Luck: fate decides if your lie goes unnoticed.
If fortune smiles upon you, the ruse works and he believes you.
If misfortune strikes you, your lie betrays you.
What do you do?

C 185 You are Lucky
C 378 You are Unlucky

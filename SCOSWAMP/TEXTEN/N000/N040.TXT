T 040 Stratagus's Tower
Overcoming your fear, you approach the sinister black tower.
Bats swirl in a cloud at the top; the heavy iron door
bears a hideous head, then it opens with a creak of hinges.
Stratagus appears: tall, thin, black robe embroidered with scarlet patterns.
His gaze is hard; the Copper Ring on your finger warms intensely.
He welcomes you with a cold smile and declares he wants a fearless hero.
"I know everything about you," he says; his voice tests your assurance.
The tension is palpable; he challenges you to prove your worth.
What do you do?

C 004 Challenge him
C 050 Affirm that you are a fearless warrior and boast about the Ring
C 097 Smile and declare that you fear nothing

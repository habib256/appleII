T 028 The Sword Trees

Several SWORD TREES attack you as if they formed a
single adversary. They cannot see you and only locate
themselves by the sounds you make. Each of them bears several
branches armed with sharp blades, and they converge in silence.
You have an advantage: they only detect sound. Show
caution and precision in your attack.
SWORD TREES SKILL: 9 STAMINA: 12
Face them by applying the combat rules from the book.
If you defeat them, continue reading at the indicated number.
Otherwise, your corpse will serve as fertilizer for the swamp.

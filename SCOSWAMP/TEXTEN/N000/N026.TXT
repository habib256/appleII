T 026 Master's Attack
You sense that the SPIDER MASTER is deeply evil
and you attack him with your sword. He defends himself with a shiny wand
whose tip is very sharp and coated with a greenish substance.
Each blow dealt by his wand will make you lose 1 additional
STAMINA point (3 instead of 2).
The combat will be tough: measure your strength and endurance.
SPIDER MASTER SKILL: 9 STAMINA: 6

C 354 You have killed the Master

T 024 Will-o'-the-Wisp Trap
The Will-o'-the-Wisp dances before you and you follow it without suspecting anything.
The ground becomes increasingly wet; suddenly you fall into a hole
filled with mud. The Will-o'-the-Wisp disappears: its presence was a deception.
Test your Luck: if you are Lucky, you will extract yourself without harm.
If you are Unlucky, you manage to get out but lose 2
STAMINA points. You eventually reach firmer ground.
Thanks to the Copper Ring you know which path to take to find
the clearing.

What do you do?

C 273 You are lucky
C 297 You are unlucky

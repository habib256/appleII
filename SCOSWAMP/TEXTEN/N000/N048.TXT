T 048 Challenge to the Villagers

You grip the pommel of your sword, ready to draw, and
issue a challenge in a resounding voice. Your attitude doesn't
impress them: on the contrary, they burst out laughing. "We're not
brawlers," they tell you. "But a lad
like you, always ready to brandish his sword, should go
take a tour in the Swamp. For people of your kind,
it's the perfect place." You feel embarrassed and lose 1
LUCK point for being too aggressive. You
catch a few mocking looks before leaving. The humid
wind already carries a heavy smell of mud. The Swamp awaits
you, and the memory of your anger weighs on you. Nothing will
change your decision: adventure lies ahead.

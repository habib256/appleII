T 002 The Globe and the Offer
His story fascinates you; soon he rises with a slow movement.
He approaches a table where a globe is placed and makes it spin.
The rotation reveals a hiding place in the sphere: Coins are
stacked there in abundance. Your eyes widen at so much gold.
Pompatarte smiles at you: "Would you accept to sell it to me?"
He offers in exchange one hundred fine Gold Pieces.

C 049 Accept the offer and sell your ring
C 173 Refuse and keep your ring

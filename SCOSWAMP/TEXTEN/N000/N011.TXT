T 011 The Beast's Dead End
You advance westward; the swamp becomes even more sinister.
Finally the path widens and leads to a narrow, long clearing.
There is no other path: you have reached a dead end.
You approach a large grey rock to lie down and
rest. Suddenly, the rock moves: it wasn't stone.
A rough fur unfolds; two red eyes stare at you, furious.
A FOUL BEAST with six clawed legs immediately advances toward you.
Its heavy breathing makes the wood vibrate; its claws tear the earth.
What do you do?

C 176 Face it in combat
C 102 Flee immediately
C 374 Try to cast a spell on it

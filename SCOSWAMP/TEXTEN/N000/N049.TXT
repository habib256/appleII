T 049 Selling the Ring
Driven by the lure of profit, you remove your Copper Ring.
You toss it on the table; Pompatarte hands you a bag and counts
out one hundred Gold Pieces. You now have enough money to
live for several years without working.
Without the Ring, there's no question of risking yourself in the Swamp.
Your adventure ends here.

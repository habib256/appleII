T 031 Crystal Pool
You advance eastward and feel you've gone too far into the swamp.
Suddenly, you enter a clearing overgrown with grass.
In the center, a pool gleams with water pure as crystal.
A small beach of fine sand borders one side of the pool.
No other path allows an exit: only the trail by which
you arrived connects you to the outside world.
You are in Clearing No. 021.
What do you do?

C 047 Leave the place by returning west
C 394 Wait a few minutes to observe

T 014 Scorpion and Dwarf
The path leads to a small clearing where several trees have fallen.
You approach and hear sounds of struggle behind a wide trunk.
The image that unfolds is terrible: a GIANT SCORPION holds a DWARF.
The beast has caught the dwarf by the neck in a claw and hurls him to the ground.
The dwarf remains lying there, lifeless, while the scorpion seems to devour him.
It seems unlikely that your Magic Stones will have any effect here.
You are in Clearing No. 032.
What do you do?

C 088 Leave the clearing while the monster feeds
C 312 Attack the Scorpion to fight it

T 004 Goblin Statue
The sorcerer bursts into evil laughter and taunts you mercilessly.
"I'm not going to waste my energy fighting such a pitiful opponent."
With a gesture he points to a niche in the wall: a GOBLIN STATUE stands there.
The statue immediately begins to move and advances toward you, sword brandished.
Its march grinds on the floor; the stone seems animated by a cold will.
The sorcerer challenges you: prove your bravery against the statue
or retaliate directly against Stratagus, if he seems more worthy.
What do you do?

C 284 Fight the goblin statue
C 123 Attack Stratagus the sorcerer

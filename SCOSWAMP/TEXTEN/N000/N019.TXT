T 019 Two Paths
You arrive at an opening where two paths divide before you.
One, to the north, is wide and well-marked: many travelers have
taken it; it seems safer and faster.
The other, to the east, is narrow, more shaded and less traveled; it may
hide surprises or offer a secret shortcut.
Which direction do you choose?

C 280 Take the wide path to the north
C 137 Take the narrow path to the east

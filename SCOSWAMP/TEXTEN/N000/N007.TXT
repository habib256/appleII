T 007 The Sorcerer's Offer
The sorcerer's face darkens; the patterns on his robe begin
to dance before your eyes in a threatening manner.
"It's better than nothing," he mutters. "Give me what you
have and you'll receive two hundred and fifty Gold Pieces in exchange."
The offer is tempting, but his sly smile suggests a trick.
Weighing the immediate gain against the future value of your items is wise.
What do you do?

C 266 Accept his offer and receive the money
C 207 Remind him that he owed you more

T 041 Quicksand
You enter a clearing surrounded by trees whose trunks
are covered with ivy. The ground suddenly becomes softer.
No other path seems present: you are caught in the center.
Without warning, the ground gives way and you begin to
sink into quicksand.
Test your Luck: if you are lucky, you lose 2
STAMINA points and manage to escape. If you are unlucky,
the situation becomes more dangerous.
You are in Clearing No. 030.
What do you do?

C 270 You are Lucky (lose 2 STAMINA)
C 087 You are Unlucky

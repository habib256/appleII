T 027 At Pompatarte's
Grognard advises you to go fetch Pompatarte at the market.
In the maze of streets you get lost; after asking everywhere,
a group of children leads you to a large house at the edge
of the market. You knock: a Goblin servant opens the door.
She leads you to the library where Pompatarte is seated.
An enormous and strange man: very tall, obese, braided beard, skin
of a bright red. You tell him your story and offer
your services. He replies: "I need them, but how do you plan
to survive the Scorpion Swamp?"
What do you say?

C 002 Tell him about the Old Woman and the Copper Ring
C 173 Assure him that you are an exceptional warrior

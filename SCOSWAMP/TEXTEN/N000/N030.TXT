T 030 Fatal Bite
You throw your boots and backpack at the foot of the cliff
then you dive. Alas, the water is too shallow and the bottom
is covered with a thick layer of mud: you find yourself
stuck. You struggle, manage to surface, breathless.
Facing you, a crocodile opens its enormous jaws.
You grab your sword and attempt a move, but it's futile.
The jaws close; the pain is brief.
Your adventure ends in the reptile's stomach.

T 006 Gayolard's House
You return to Gayolard's house. A fire crackles in the
fireplace and a delicious smell rises: some dish is simmering.
The sorcerer welcomes you cordially and looks at you carefully.
He then asks you a simple and decisive question: "Do you have the berry?"
If it's the purple fruit of the Asphodel, everything changes.
What do you do?

C 175 Yes, I bring him the Asphodel berry
C 052 No, I did not bring him the berry

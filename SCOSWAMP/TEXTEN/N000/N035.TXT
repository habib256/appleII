T 035 The Cursed Magnet
The orcs shoot two arrows: they miss you, then curve
and embed themselves in your Backpack. Only one scratches your shoulder.
You lose 1 STAMINA point.
You then understand that the Gold Magnet is cursed: it attracts arrows.
By luck, it was stored in your bag and not worn on you.
What do you do?

C 281 Attack with your sword
C 399 Resort to magic
C 309 Flee

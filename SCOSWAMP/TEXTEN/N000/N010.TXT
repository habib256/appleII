T 010 The Battle Clearing

You pass through gnarled trees and enter a new clearing.
This is Clearing No. 5. If you've been here before,
go to 142. Otherwise, read what follows.
The place bears the recent marks of combat: the ground is
trampled, the wet grass stained with blood, and two arrows are
still stuck in a tree a little further on. Footprints
lead east and west, as if opposing forces had
clashed here recently. You can search the clearing
to discover clues or loot, but staying risks
attracting the attention of hidden enemies. What do you do?

C 059 Examine the clearing and search for clues
C 227 Leave the clearing as quickly as possible and depart

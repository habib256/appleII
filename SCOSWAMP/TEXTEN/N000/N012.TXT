T 012 Battle against the Giant
The GIANT begins to fight, shouting in fury.
His strength is extraordinary, but he is clumsy in his movements.
When his club hits its target, you suffer 4 damage points
instead of 2: the power of the blow doubles the endurance loss.
The combat is brutal; measure your blows and keep your breath.
GIANT SKILL: 9 STAMINA: 12

C 061 If you reduce the GIANT's STAMINA to 6
C 161 Flee in the middle of battle

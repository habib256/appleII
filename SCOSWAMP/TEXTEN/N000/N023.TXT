T 023 The Mistress's Help
The Copper Ring remains cold: a sign that the Bird Mistress
is benevolent. You explain the object of your quest to her.

manages to get a map of the Swamp, the dishonest sorcerers
will steal it from him and plunder his caravans. You are brave;
I will help you avoid the greatest dangers of your journey."
What do you do?

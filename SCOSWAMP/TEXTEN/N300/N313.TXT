T 313 Drowning in the River

The river water is warm and the ice piece is
melting under your feet. A few moments later, it breaks
into several other pieces and you swim desperately toward
the bank, your sword in hand to defend yourself
against any attack. Alas! your Backpack is too heavy and
you sink to the bottom getting mired in the slime the
waterway carries. We regret to inform you that your
adventure ends here.

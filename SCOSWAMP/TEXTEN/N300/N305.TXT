T 305 The Garden Master

The path oriented eastward is very well maintained, the trees and
bushes have been carefully trimmed and their foliage
doesn't invade the trail. Soon, you arrive before a
pleasant clearing. This is Clearing No. 27. If you've been
there before, go to 238. Otherwise, read what follows. All sorts
of plants and flowers grow here and there: clearly, they're
taken great care of and the place seems quite welcoming. This
clearing indeed seems too beautiful to be entirely
natural, but too natural as well to be truly a
garden. As you cast a glance around you, a
man approaches: he's tall, broad-shouldered and wears
earth-stained clothes. You guess however that you're
not dealing with a simple gardener, for he wears around his neck
a Silver flower-shaped Amulet: this is the GARDEN
MASTER. Your Copper Ring remains cold: this man
is driven by friendly intentions. Which sorcerer do you
serve?

T 308 The Purple Jewel

The Basin Beast is finally dead. Using your sword, you
cut the flesh of its forehead to detach the large Purple
Jewel and you leave immediately without forgetting to record your
new acquisition on your Adventure Sheet. The only path
that allows leaving the clearing takes you back westward.

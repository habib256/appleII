T 326 Stratagus's Fury

He contemplates the broken table, the books scattered around, the
broken porcelain... the statue debris spread on the floor, then
raises his gaze to you. His face then convulses under
the effect of fury and contempt. "Why therefore should I pay
you the slightest attention?" he exclaims, "you're just
good enough to defeat a little Statue of nothing at all and, moreover,
you have the audacity to wreck my salon!" What will you do?

C 98 Grovel before him to beg his forgiveness

C 225 Remind him it's because of him

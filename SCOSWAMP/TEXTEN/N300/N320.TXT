T 320 The Unicorn

The path follows a slight downward slope and leads to a
clearing with ground overgrown with grass. This is Clearing No. 29. If you've
been there before, go to 265. Otherwise, read what follows. A
white-colored animal lies in the clearing's center.
You first think it's a horse, but when it turns
its head in your direction, you immediately recognize a
UNICORN. It seems wounded: scratch marks are visible
on its flank. It rises however and lowers its horn toward
you letting out a growl strongly resembling a challenge.
What will you do?

C 368 Flee

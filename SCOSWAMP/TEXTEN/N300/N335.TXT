T 335 At Gayolard's

You leave the tavern. Outside, there's exceptional sunshine and you blink
for a few moments to get accustomed to this brilliant brightness.
You then set off. You ask an old
man leaning against his shop window where the good
sorcerer Gayolard lives. He's friendly and indicates
which direction to take. A little further, you get lost,
but a large woman with a rubicund face takes
pleasure in informing you. It seems everyone here
knows Gayolard's dwelling. You finally arrive before a
small house on the village edge. Gayolard, a small
plump man, dressed in a white tunic and linen pants, is
engaged in pottery in his garden. You
approach him and tell him your story. He then smiles
and asks how you plan to go about
crossing this Swamp no one has ever succeeded in mapping.

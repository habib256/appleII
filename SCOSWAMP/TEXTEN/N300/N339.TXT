T 339 Ice Raft

When the bridge breaks, you manage to set foot
on the largest piece of ice. You thus have a
sort of raft on which you can descend the river's
course eastward. On both sides, the banks are
covered with thick vegetation. Soon, you see
before you an old stone bridge of impressive
size.

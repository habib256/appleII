T 332 Spider Master's Trap

Indifferent to the warning your Copper Ring
gives you, you address the Spider Master in a very
friendly tone. He answers you politely asking what
brings you here. You're about to explain when
you suddenly feel a sharp pain in your neck. The Master then bursts
into joyous laughter. You immediately turn around and find
yourself before a large black spider dangling from
a thread attached to a branch. Its venom quickly
spreads in your blood and you collapse on the ground,
unable to move. In a semi-fog, you see the
Spider Master searching your Backpack to examine the
loot he's just appropriated. Then you feel yourself being
lifted from behind and hoisted onto a tree's
branch. A few moments later you find yourself wrapped
in a spider web and you remain there, suspended between heaven and
earth. In a week or two, the Spiders living in these
places will doubtless judge your carcass ripe and will offer themselves
at your expense a delectable meal. It's clear, of course, that
your adventure is over.

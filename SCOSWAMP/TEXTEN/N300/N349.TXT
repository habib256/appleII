T 349 Departure from the Tower

You shrug and you leave the room; you walk along the
dark corridor then you pass through the door with the hideous
sculpture. Some distance before you take shape the
village's contours as you move away from the tower of
Evil. You've fought all sorts of creatures, men and
animals, you've ten times risked your life and all this for what
? Evil is an ungrateful and dangerous master, and you can
consider yourself fortunate to have succeeded without too much difficulty in escaping
thus from Stratagus's clutches. You're alive, that's essential,
and, in the future, there's no doubt you'll show yourself
more circumspect in choosing the masters you'll serve.
Your adventure, in any case, ends here.

T 328 Friendship Stone on the Giant

The Giant isn't finally as mean as he looks. Something
made him furious, simply, and when you throw him
the Friendship Magic Stone, he starts laughing letting his
club drop to the ground. "I really wonder why I
spoke to you like that," he says. "It's not your fault, I had gotten angry
at someone else. What brings you here? If I
can help you, I'd be happy to do so." Relieved that your
spell avoided bloodshed, you tell him of your
mission. Which sorcerer have you decided to serve?

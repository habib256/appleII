T 336 The Slime Basin

You're in a particularly marshy zone,
and each of your steps produces a sucking sound on the ground.
Soon, the path turns slightly and runs along a large basin.
You're in a clearing accessible only
by this single trail. This is Clearing No. 28. If you've
been there before, go to 137. Otherwise, read what follows. The basin's
water is agitated by wavelets and a greenish Slime
covers its surface. This certainly isn't where you'd
wish to quench your thirst! Suddenly, the basin's filth seems
to contract and you're stunned to see it rise and
spread on the trail, barring your passage. This is
a large mass of viscous SLIME two meters wide giving off
a repugnant smell while slowly crawling toward you. What will
you do?

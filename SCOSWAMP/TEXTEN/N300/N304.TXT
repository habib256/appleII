T 304 The Parrot

As you advance northward, the Swamp
changes appearance. It becomes less gloomy and looks more and
more like a tropical jungle. Brightly colored birds
fly among the trees and you soon see a clearing a
little further. This is Clearing No. 14. If you've been there before,
go to 149. Otherwise, read what follows. Perched on a
branch, a large red and yellow Parrot observes you
attentively. When you approach it, it speaks to you:
"Who are you and what do you want from the Bird Mistress?"
it asks. What will you do?

C 71 Attack the Parrot
C 131 Ask to meet its Mistress

T 341 Attack Against Pompatarte

His casual attitude toward you, when you've risked
your life trying to fulfill your mission, seems completely
unacceptable. You therefore draw your sword and attack
him with the firm intention of making him pay dearly for his lightness. He's
surprised, but nonetheless dodges your first blow. Despite his
imposing mass, he moves with much skill and soon
draws a sword from behind his desk. He defends himself
vigorously and you realize very quickly you're dealing with
a formidable adversary.
POMPATARTE SKILL: 9 STAMINA: 14
He has his back to the door, and if you wish to Flee, you'll
have to dive through the window.

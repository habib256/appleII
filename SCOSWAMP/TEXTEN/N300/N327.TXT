T 327 Flight Through the Window

He's much more dangerous than you thought. Who could
have believed that such a fat man of such ridiculous appearance can
fight with such skill? You then turn around and
dive through the window, hoping to escape.
Alas! a veritable crowd has gathered before
Pompatarte's house, and barely have you had time to regain your
senses after such a fall that two robust soldiers
tie your hands behind your back. Your treachery toward the
merchant will earn you spending long years in the
town's jails. Your adventure therefore ends here.

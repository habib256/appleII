T 347 Illusion Spell

Thanks to your Illusion Spell, you take the appearance of a
plant. Stunned, the Garden Master then approaches you
and you try to snatch his Amulet. Your movement
however has broken the spell and the Garden Master, seeing
you reappear in your usual form, leaps
backward. The attempt has failed.

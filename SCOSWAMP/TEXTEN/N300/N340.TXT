T 340 Stratagus's Death

Your sword's blade sinks deep into his chest.
He then looks at you with an incredulous air and opens his mouth with
the manifest intention of telling you something, but he has neither
the strength nor the time and dies almost immediately. The serrated weapon slips
from his fingers and you pick it up, intrigued by its unusual
shape. It doesn't take you long to realize
it's a Magic Sword with great
powers that add 2 points to the SKILL total of whoever
uses it in combat. Nothing surprising, in these conditions, that
Stratagus showed such great skill during your
duel! You then begin searching the sorcerer's sinister tower
to try discovering the treasures he's hidden there.
But the atmosphere soon becomes heavy and oppressive. Your
ring is still as hot, thus warning you of
perhaps even greater danger than before. You also smell
sulfur.

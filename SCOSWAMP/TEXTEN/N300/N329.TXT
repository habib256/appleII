T 329 The Luminous Mushroom

The clearing where you had met the Frog Master is
empty now. In the semi-darkness reigning around, you
see a faint glow coming from the mushroom on
which he was sitting. You approach it and you carefully
examine the mushroom. You then notice traces
of human teeth on one of the cap's edges. The
mushroom gives off a pleasant smell and you can
eat a piece if you wish.

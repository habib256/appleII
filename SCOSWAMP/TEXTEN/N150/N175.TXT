T 175 The Asphodel Miracle
You carefully take from your pocket the Asphodel berry.
"Marvelous!" exclaims Gayolard, beaming with joy.
He takes it in his trembling hands and places it in his garden.

A few magic words later, the earth comes alive:
a stem springs up, rises, and becomes a large bush loaded
with purple clusters perfuming the air.
The old sorcerer replants several berries, and other shoots
appear immediately. The life cycle is reborn before your eyes.

Gayolard turns to you, moved:
"Thanks to you, the Asphodel will live again.
I will send some to my brother mages.
The magical world will owe you much, adventurer."

He offers you Healing Potions and a hot meal.
You spend the evening talking before leaving,
your heart light, duty accomplished, ready for other quests.

END OF ADVENTURE - COMPLETE SUCCESS

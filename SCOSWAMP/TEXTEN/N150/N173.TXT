T 173 The Red Merchant
Pompatarte bursts into thunderous laughter that shakes the walls.

Intrigued, you ask him what his goal is in the Swamp.
"Information! If I had a map of the Scorpion Swamp,
I could pass my caravans through and save weeks.
Bring me a clear map leading to the town of Courbensaule,
and I'll offer you half the profits of my first year!"

Pompatarte then opens a box filled with glittering Stones.
"Choose five, all neutral, they will be useful to you."
You note your five Magic Stones on your Adventure Sheet.

He shakes your hand with a grip of steel, then the Goblin
shows you out. You leave the village, heading north,
toward the dark Scorpion Swamp, map and destiny in hand.

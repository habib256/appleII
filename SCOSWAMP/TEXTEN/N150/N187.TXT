T 187 Three Paths
You are in the clearing; three paths open before you.
The southern trail descends toward low mists and peat bogs.
The eastern track runs along the river; you can hear the water murmuring.
The western path runs through dense, dark woods.
Which direction do you choose?

C 144 Go south
C 290 Take the eastern road along the river
C 010 Head west through the woods

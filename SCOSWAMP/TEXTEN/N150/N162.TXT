T 162 The Trusting Master
He believes your story and chatters willingly; you thus learn
that the Masters form a circle of sorcerers with changing alliances.
Their bond lies in the Amulets they wear: a Master cannot kill
another as long as he wears his amulet. These jewels have power
only when a sorcerer wears them, he says, then resumes his speech.
You thank him and back up to the path entrance, out of his sight.
What do you do?

C 352 Leave for good
C 245 Try to steal the Amulet with an Illusion Stone
C 062 Attack him with your sword

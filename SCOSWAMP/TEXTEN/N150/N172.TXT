T 172 The Interview with the Wolf Master

You chat for a few moments.
"Take the simplest path to cross the river,
the Wolf Master advises you, don't see traps where
there are none."
He also teaches you a short magic formula that
you can speak if ever Wolves threaten you.
If you say it, they will then show themselves completely benevolent
toward you and allow you to pass without aggression.
You listen attentively and repeat it softly to
better remember it. The Master smiles as if granting
you his trust. It's time to leave the clearing: you take
your leave, gather your things and prepare to leave,
more serene thanks to this teaching.

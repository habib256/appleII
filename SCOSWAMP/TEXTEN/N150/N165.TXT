T 165 Two Paths
You are in a small clearing, barely protected from the winds.
Only two paths allow you to continue your journey.
The northern path climbs between rocks; mists can be seen.
The southern trail runs toward calmer, darker undergrowth.
What do you do?

C 388 Take the northern path
C 105 Take the southern path

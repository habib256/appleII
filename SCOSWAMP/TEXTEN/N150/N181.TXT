T 181 The Bear's Return
Through the trees, you make out a familiar silhouette.
The Bear is back - and this time, it seems determined to
fight. Its eyes gleam with tenacious rage: it remembers
you.

If it had been wounded previously, it has regained 1 STAMINA point.
Otherwise, it fights with all its vigor.

T 180 The Brigand's Honor
The Copper Ring is your only precious possession, but your word
obliges you. You remove it reluctantly and hand it to the Brigand Chief.
He sees your sadness and frowns.

"Keep it," he says in a sincere voice.
"You have shown honesty and courage.
I would be a scoundrel if I took the only thing you have left."

He gives you a friendly pat on the shoulder,
and you feel mutual respect being born.

C 214 Continue your journey with their friendship

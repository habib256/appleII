T 190 Jump Over the Sands
You step back to get momentum and test your LUCK.
Test: roll 2 dice (2d6). If total <= LUCK, you are Lucky
and jump to the other side without difficulty.
Otherwise, you are Unlucky: your leap is too short and you
must wade through the quicksand. Lose 2 STAMINA.
Then resume walking.

C 270 Continue after the jump

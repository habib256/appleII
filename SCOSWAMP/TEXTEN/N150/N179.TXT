T 179 The Three-Way Crossroads

Three paths allow you to leave this clearing. The path
oriented north seems to follow a downward slope. South
leads back to the previous clearing, while east plunges
deeper into the Swamp. Which path do you choose?
Weigh quickly: each direction will lead you to different
trials and diverse encounters.

C 183 Take the path descending northward
C 010 Return to the clearing southward
C 118 Take the path plunging eastward

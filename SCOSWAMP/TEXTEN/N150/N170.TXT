T 170 The Green Patroller
The narrow path winds between large rocks in thick
fog. The mist suddenly lifts and you emerge into a clearing.
A man, tall and tanned, entirely dressed in green, greets you
from atop a rock. He's a PATROLLER.
"Hey, adventurer! Are you in the service of Good or Evil?"
You are in Clearing No. 019.
Which sorcerer do you serve?

C 029 Stratagus
C 262 Pompatarte

T 158 Success: the Map is Complete
You smile and pull from your pocket a crumpled parchment:
the map you've drawn through the Swamp. Paths, clearings
and perils are carefully marked. Pompatarte follows your explanations,
delighted. When you finish, he gives you a great slap
on the back that makes you stagger. "Marvelous! Absolutely perfect!"
He opens a drawer and takes out an enormous emerald he offers you.
"Consider this as a bonus. My first caravan leaves tomorrow.
You will be my guest as long as you wish. And half
of a year's savings will be yours, as promised."
You thank him, satisfied: Pompatarte is a man of his word.
Your mission succeeded and your adventure ends here.

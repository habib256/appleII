T 153 Flight from the Clearing
You leave the clearing as quickly as possible, short of breath.
The air is heavy, and you cast a last look behind you before
resuming the path. Two directions offer themselves to you: north
or west. The ground seems drier there, but danger remains.

C 218 Go north
C 065 Take the western path

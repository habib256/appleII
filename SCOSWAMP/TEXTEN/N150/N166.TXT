T 166 The Patroller and the Return Path
The Patroller congratulates you for your bravery.
"You did well, adventurer!" he says with a smile.
"All you have left to do now is to leave the Scorpion Swamp alive.
Listen carefully to my instructions:"

 -> Take **the southern direction**,
 -> then go **east**,
 -> then **south again** when you reach **the Eagle's Nest**,
 -> next, go **west**,
 -> and finally **south** one last time.

"If you follow this route to the letter, you will reach the southern edge of the Swamp.
Beyond, the ground becomes firm again and you will be safe."

You thank him sincerely, carefully noting these precious directions.
The Patroller salutes you with a nod before disappearing into the mist.

T 193 Stratagus's Potions
Stratagus observes the disorder of the room, then shrugs
laughing: "So be it, let's talk business now."
He leads you to another room and returns with several vials
of shimmering colors. "Drink, it will do you good," he says.

You hesitate, then taste the contents of a bottle.
The sorcerer laughs at your caution, but he was telling the truth: you feel
your strength returning.
It was a Healing Potion!
You empty the other vials and, against all expectations, none are
poisoned. Your SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK points
return to their initial total.

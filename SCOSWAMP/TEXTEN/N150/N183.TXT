T 183 Cliff Summit
You climb: the ground becomes rocky and the path rises.
Soon, instead of the dreary foliage, the sky opens.
You reach the summit of a high cliff overlooking the river.
You are in Clearing No. 20.
Below, muddy waters flow far beneath you.
Lazy crocodiles float in the sun in the water.
Further east, a bridge spans the waterway, inaccessible.
No trail runs along the bank; several paths offer themselves to you.

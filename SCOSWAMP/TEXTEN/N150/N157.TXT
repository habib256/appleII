T 157 The Sword Trees Clearing

The path narrows worryingly and you fear
reaching a dead end. A few meters further, it
widens and you enter a very small clearing.
This is Clearing No. 18. If you've been here before, go
to 279. Otherwise, continue reading.
The place is surrounded by strangely shaped trees: small,
dark green, with branches resembling arms.
Soon, you notice that each arm holds a sword at its
end. These trees move and converge toward you.
You are attacked by SWORD TREES! They encircle you
and prepare their assault.

C 028 Fight the Sword Trees with your sword
C 203 Resort to magic to defend yourself

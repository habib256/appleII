T 191 Magic Stone Choice

Facing the Wolf Master, a sword fight would be risky.
Your fingers search for the Magic Stones Gayolard entrusted to you.
Time is pressing: the beasts growl and the Master gauges you with a
piercing gaze. Choosing the right Stone can reverse the encounter,
but beware: a spent Stone is lost forever.
Each Stone has its own effect; some effects can turn
against you if the situation isn't adapted. You feel the power
vibrating in your hand; the slightest error could be fatal.
Think quickly and well. Here are your options:

C 224 Use a Terror Stone
C 294 Use a Friendship Stone
C 093 Use a Curse Stone
C 064 Use a Fire Stone
C 398 Give up magic and make another choice

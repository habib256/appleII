T 155 Grognard's Blessing

You appear sincere, and Grognard nods with a wide
smile. "There are rough and simple beings who always fight
for Good. Good Gayolard is one of them. And you,
young paladin, you are of the same breed." His words vibrate with
surprising force. Strangely, Grognard suddenly appears
taller. Is that a cross embroidered on his clothes? And that
sword at his side, where does it come from? You want to question, but
he extends his hand and touches your forehead. Dizziness seizes you. His
voice thunders: "Be blessed, paladin, and seek Gayolard." The next
moment, he has disappeared. You regain your senses. Your unease
immediately fades. Better still, you feel renewed,
filled with energy. Your doubts have dissipated. Fate has just
granted you a precious gift.

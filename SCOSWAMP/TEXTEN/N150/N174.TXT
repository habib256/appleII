T 174 Threat at Stratagus's
You cast a cold gaze on Stratagus; his servant's corpse lies.
The sorcerer mutters, furious and indecisive; a spell in preparation is sensed.
The atmosphere is tense: he can retaliate magically or try to talk.
Act quickly: attack or negotiate, each choice will have heavy consequences.
What do you do?

C 225 Attack him immediately
C 193 Invite him to talk business

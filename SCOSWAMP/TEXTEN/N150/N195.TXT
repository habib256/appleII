T 195 Clearing Number 1

You arrive in Clearing No. 1. In truth, it's only
a wide roundabout from which three paths depart. The ground is
unstable and waterlogged, and large clouds of insects flutter
above the stagnant ponds covering the place. The
humid fog rises in swirls, and each step makes dirty
water splash under your boots. The stunted trees bordering the
clearing seem twisted, as if marked by the corruption
of the swamp. You hesitate: advance slowly or attempt a risky
jump over the softest zones. Silence weighs
around you, only troubled by the buzzing
of insects and the sound of water. The path opening to the
north seems solid, but nothing assures you it doesn't hide
new traps. Here, each decision can be the
frontier between survival and disaster. You grip your sword,
ready to choose the path that will allow you to leave this
clearing without losing your strength. Danger is tangible.

C 058 Carefully cross the clearing to another path

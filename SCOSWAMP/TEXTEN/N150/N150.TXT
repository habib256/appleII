T 150 The Potion Merchant
The street leading to the town exit is lined with small shops.
One catches your eye: ALPHONSE MACHEFER, POTION MERCHANT
AND MAGIC DEALER. You enter immediately. The young man with
thick beard and prominent nose welcomes you with a cautious smile.
He's a neutral sorcerer: he only sells neutral Magic Stones.

You don't have enough Gold Pieces for his prices, but certain objects
from your bag interest him. He accepts a fair exchange:
- Purple Jewel
- Gold Chain
- Silver Amulet (from one of the Masters)
- Gold Magnet
- Unicorn Horn

Each of these objects can be exchanged for a neutral Magic Stone
of your choice (max. 3 stones). Cross out exchanged objects from your sheet
and record your new stones. Then, you leave the shop and
resume the journey south, toward the Scorpion Swamp.

C 343 Leave the shop and head back south

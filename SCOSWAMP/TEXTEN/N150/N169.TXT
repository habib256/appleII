T 169 The Snake Illusion
You throw your Illusion Stone and make appear the image
of a venomous snake between you and the Orcs.

But they are not frightened at all.
One of them even leans forward with a carnivorous grin
and tries to catch the illusory snake!
Your stratagem has failed... all that's left is to fight.

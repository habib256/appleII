T 163 The Brigands' Duel
You advance into the clearing with a calm step.
The five Brigands, surprised by your assurance, stop short.
"Hey there! Where are you going like that?" asks one of them.
"North," you reply calmly.

Your composure impresses them.
These men are used to taxing travelers, but they're not assassins.
Their chief, a fellow with a battle beard, then advances:

"We don't rob brave folk," he says.
"But if you're so sure of yourself, let's prove it in a duel!
First blood declares the winner:
- If I touch you, you'll give me a valuable object.
- If you wound me, we'll let you pass without asking anything."

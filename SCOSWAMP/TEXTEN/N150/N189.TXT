T 189 The Discovered Stones

You notice that the earth has been disturbed at the foot of one of the trees
bordering the clearing. You dig immediately at this precise
spot and find two Magic Stones: one of Friendship,
the other of LUCK. Record them on your Adventure Sheet.
These objects may be useful to you later in your
quest. You carefully stow the Stones in your purse,
then resume the journey, your heart light at having gained these
precious resources.

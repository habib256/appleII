T 164 The Bird Mistress
The Copper Ring remains cold: the Bird Mistress is therefore benevolent.
You explain the purpose of your mission and she immediately begins hopping with joy:
"So there's still an Asphodel bush? What wonder!"
Her enthusiasm is so sincere that for a moment she resembles a delighted little girl.

Aware of the importance of your quest for the cause of Good,
she hands you a **magic potion**:
it has the power to restore to their initial value your
SKILL, STAMINA or LUCK points - your choice.

Then, with a gesture, she calls several birds that come swirling around her.
She murmurs a few words to them, listens to them, then turns to you:
"Gayolard was right," she says softly,
"there is indeed an Asphodel bush, northeast of the Swamp.
I can help you get there."

You accept with gratitude.

T 197 Giant's Mourning
The Giant's corpse rests in the center of the clearing.
Kneeling near him, an immense woman weeps hot tears.
She's doubtless his wife. She looks at you, desperate,
without threatening you. You don't think of attacking her.
Remorse overcomes you: lose 2 LUCK points.
You swear never to return here, except in absolute necessity.

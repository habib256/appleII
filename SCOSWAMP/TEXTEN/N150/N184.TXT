T 184 False Amulet
You give up attacking the Bird Mistress and tell her
your mission, entrusted by an evil sorcerer. She nods,
saddened: "I shouldn't help you, you serve Evil. But you're not
evil, otherwise you wouldn't have spoken so frankly."
After a moment, she smiles: "I will forge a false Amulet
in the shape of a bird. Whoever sees it will believe it authentic; thus
Stratagus will be deceived and you won't bother my brothers."
"If you meet the Spider Master, kill him: he's a harmful being."
With a gesture, an amulet identical to hers appears in your palm.
You thank her and prepare to leave.

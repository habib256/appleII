T 264 Withering Stone Failure

You throw the Withering Stone at the Garden Master,
but he's not a plant: the spell has no effect on
him. A tree located behind him however dies immediately.
Furious, the Master throws a Fire spell at you. Your hair
ignites; you smother it by striking your head.
The burns cost you 2 STAMINA points.
You then brandish your sword and prepare for combat.

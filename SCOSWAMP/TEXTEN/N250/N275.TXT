T 275 The Giant
A hole in the ground soon makes you stumble. You look
down and then realize that the hole in question is
actually a fifty-centimeter-long footprint, left there
by an enormous hobnailed boot. You're at the entrance of
Clearing No. 7. If you've been there before, go to 342.
Otherwise, read what follows. You enter the clearing and find
yourself face to face with a GIANT of fantastic size. He looks
furious and brandishes a large spiked club.
Your Copper Ring remains cold, so it's not an
evil creature. The Giant is nonetheless dangerous for
that. "IT IS FORBIDDEN TO PASS!" he yells at you.
What will you do?

C 12 Attack him
C 229 Try to calm him
C 145 Resort to magic

T 290 Swamp Orcs
You make out traces indicating someone passed through
recently. At some distance before you lies
another clearing. This is Clearing No. 26. If you've been before,
go to 323. Otherwise, read what follows. When you enter
this new clearing, an arrow grazes your head
whistling. You then see three SWAMP ORCS with
skin eaten by scabies. They have bows in hand, and the two
creatures who haven't yet fired shoot their arrows at you.

C 83 If you possess the Gold Magnet
C 151 Otherwise

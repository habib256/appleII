T 251 Garden Master
You have killed the Garden Master. He was a good sorcerer who meant
no harm to anyone, and you begin to regret your act.
You lose 3 LUCK points. You seize the flower-shaped
Amulet he wore around his neck, then resume the only
path that allows leaving the clearing. The trail is oriented toward
the west and plunges between old twisted oaks.

C 363 Follow the path westward, wearing the Amulet

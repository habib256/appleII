T 286 The Giant's Handkerchief
An idea suddenly comes to you that almost makes you burst
out laughing, but you hold back not to offend the unfortunate
Giant. You then search in your Backpack and pull out
the Red Cape. "Is this your handkerchief?" you ask him
handing him the fabric. The Giant immediately takes it from your hands,
looking quite joyful. "Where did you find it?" he asks. You
tell him about your encounter with the Thief, it's doubtless he
who stole his handkerchief from the Giant. The latter starts
crying again, but this time they're tears of joy flowing on
his face. He swears he'll be your friend forever and asks
you what brought you here. "Is there something I
can do to help you?" he inquires. You tell him of
your mission. Which Sorcerer's service did you enter?

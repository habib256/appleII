T 261 Curse and Spider

You throw your Curse against the Spider Master.
His cry turns into convulsions; he collapses, writhes and then
rises in an abominable form: an immense gray spider
with giant body and man's head, eyes full of hatred.
A cold runs through you - the Curse also affects you.
Roll a die; you lose as many STAMINA points as the
number obtained. If you survive, the Giant Spider attacks you.
GIANT SPIDER SKILL: 8 STAMINA: 9
You cannot flee; you must fight to the death.

C 354 Fight the Spider until one of you dies

T 255 Stratagus's Tower

As soon as you see Stratagus's tower, your Copper
Ring starts heating around your finger.
The tower stands near the swamp, dark, surrounded by statues
with grimacing faces; tall arcades let filter
a cold light. The gargoyles seem to watch every step.
The sensation of heat intensifies as you
approach; passersby avoid you and whisper.
Stratagus's name is enough to close mouths: an evil
being, they murmur. The swamp trees rustle.
The wrought iron portal is massive; it eyes you, almost
alive. You weigh your options: go to the door or turn
back. What choice do you make?

C 139 Back away and return to the village

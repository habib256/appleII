T 258 Resorting to Magic

Resorting to magic against a sorcerer is a hazardous enterprise.
The air vibrates, energy rumbles around your hands. Each spell has a price.
"Fear" can break his will, but risks provoking paralyzing visions.
"Friendship" attempts to corrupt his heart or sow doubt; subtle approach.
Doing nothing allows you to observe and keep the initiative, but you
lose the advantage of being first to act. Weigh the power, cost and risk.

C 198 Pronounce the Fear spell to break his will
C 127 Attempt the Friendship spell to sow doubt and hesitation
C 212 Cast neither, wait and choose another spell

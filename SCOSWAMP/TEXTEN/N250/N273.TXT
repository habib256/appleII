T 273 Flight from the Tower
As you hurry along the path leading to the
village, your Copper Ring starts tingling your finger.
You then glance over your shoulder and
see a black form flying from the tower. You immediately
hide in bushes and observe the creature
that has thus launched in pursuit of you, but you'll never
know who or what it was exactly. After a
moment, indeed, the mysterious black silhouette returns to
the tower's summit and you start running at full speed
until you've reached the village where you arrive out
of breath and considerably disheveled. You'd better
choose another patron!

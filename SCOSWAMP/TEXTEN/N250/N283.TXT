T 283 The Garden Master
The Garden Master is delighted. You promise him to
ask Gayolard to send him Asphodel berries then
you show him the path to get to the clearing
where you found the bush. He then gives you a beneficial
Magic Stone (choose yourself which one, by
referring to the list) and you then continue your path. Only
one trail allows leaving this clearing, you take it
therefore returning westward.

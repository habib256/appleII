T 292 The Garden Master's Amulet
You explain the nature of your mission to the Garden Master.
He then nods sadly then removes the flower-shaped
Amulet from his neck and puts it around yours. At the moment
the Amulet touches you, you're completely paralyzed and the
Garden Master, looking you straight in the eyes, orders
you to tell him everything about yourself. An irrepressible force
obliges you to obey and you tell him your life. "You're
not a bad fellow," says the Garden Master when you've
finished. "But you serve a despicable master. The
best thing I can do for you is to
advise you to always be on your guard." He then recovers
his Amulet and moves away. Gradually, you regain
your body's mobility and you leave taking the western
direction.

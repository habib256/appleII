T 280 Road to Courbensaule
You follow the trail heading north. It gradually widens
and the Swamp itself becomes less sinister. Then, soon, the
marshes give way to forest and you finally arrive before
a signpost that reads: ROAD TO COURBENSAULE. If
you've been to Courbensaule before, go to 355. Otherwise, read what
follows. A few minutes later, you
hear voices and meet forest guards with
whom you walk to the town of
Courbensaule.
After so many adventures, the only thing you need is
to find an inn to spend a good night's
sleep. The Forest Guards tell you there are three
inns in Courbensaule. Which will you choose?

C 395 The Black Bear
C 78 The Twisted Lance
C 289 Tancred's Flying Horse

T 289 Tancred's Flying Horse
The Forest Guards told you that "Tancred's Flying Horse"
was the least expensive of the three inns and so that's
where you decided to spend the night. The room price is
very reasonable indeed since they only ask you
half a Gold Piece. You go up to bed and fall
asleep as soon as you've put your head on the pillow. In the middle of
the night, however, a burning sensation on your finger
wakes you abruptly. The Copper Ring is
warning you that danger threatens. You then jump from your bed
and seize your sword; at that moment, a shadow flees
the room. You then double-lock the door and
go back to bed. When you wake in the morning, you
feel well rested and you recover 2 STAMINA points.
Alas! you realize your night thief
stole something from you. Cross out from your Adventure Sheet two
objects of your choice, Magic Stone or other, except for
the Copper Ring which remained on your finger. You now
leave the inn to resume your path. Test your
Luck.

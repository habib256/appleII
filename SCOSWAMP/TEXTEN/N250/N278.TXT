T 278 Terror Stone
You want to frighten the Brigands to make them flee, but
without harming them and you therefore use against them a Terror
Stone. A moment later, you leap from behind the
trees yelling and brandishing your sword. The Brigands are
terrified, they think you're part of a real army
come to invade their territory and they flee at full speed,
disappearing among the trees surrounding the clearing. You then
pass before them running while they bury themselves
in the mud to better hide. The way is clear for you and
you go to 19.

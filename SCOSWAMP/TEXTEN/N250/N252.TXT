T 252 Curse Stone
Gathering your courage, you throw a Curse stone
toward the Giant. He staggers, lets out a muted roar,
rubs his eyes with great gestures and immediately becomes blind.
He passes before you staggering, then falls into the deep mud.
You take advantage of the occasion to move away, heart pounding.
A strange cold runs through you however: the spell also affects you.
Roll a die; you lose as many STAMINA points as the number
obtained. If you survive, continue your journey and keep your strength.

T 263 Pincer Grass

You recognize the place where you were attacked by the Pincer
Grass. The air still smells of humidity and brown stains mark the
ground where the deadly vines closed. If you killed
them all, nothing will disturb your passage and you can
resume your journey without risk. Otherwise, the zone remains dangerous
and it would be better to avoid it or run to cross it without delay.

C 187 I went all the way: the Grass is dead, I pass
C 033 The Grass is still alive, I change route or I flee

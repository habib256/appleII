T 254 Tree Bridge

You throw the Withering Magic Stone at a large tree planted
on the bank. The tree immediately falls and forms a bridge to the opposite
shore. You cross at a rapid pace while the wood creaks
under your boots and the earth trembles slightly. When you
finally reach the other side, the tree literally decomposes and
collapses into the current, carrying its roots and branches.
Before you, two distinct paths take shape: one climbs toward
the north, the other runs toward the south. The choice is yours.

C 157 Take the path northward
C 398 Take the path southward

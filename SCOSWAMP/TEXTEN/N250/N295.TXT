T 295 The Croupie River
You soon find yourself in a small clearing on the bank of
the Croupie River. This is Clearing No. 33. The opposite shore is
200 meters away at least and the waterway is infested with
crocodiles and other creatures just as unwelcoming.
What will you do?

C 183 Walk eastward, along the bank
C 94 Go southward instead
C 89 Throw an Ice Magic Stone

T 272 Return to the Village
You manage somehow to return to the village. You're
exhausted and soaked because you fell into a mud
pond. Reduce your LUCK total by 2 points and thank
heaven you're still alive. You take a hot bath at the inn
and then feel noticeably better. You then go
find Grognard apologizing for your impetuousness. He
nods and sketches a smile. "You're lucky and
you're resilient, otherwise, you would never even have come back
alive," he says.

C 205 Listen to Grognard

T 284 Goblin Statue
The stone creature advances toward you dragging its feet
while Stratagus, quite satisfied with this spectacle, emits little
diabolical laughs. Obviously, your sword will be
of no help against an opponent hard as rock. You
think for a fraction of a second then you bring down your weapon
on the sorcerer's table: the blade splits the wood and you manage to
detach one of the table's legs. You then drop
your sword and you face the statue with this
improvised club that will be much more effective in the present
situation. Stratagus, impressed by your strength and
the promptness of your reflexes, stops laughing and carefully
observes the combat.

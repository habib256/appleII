T 256 Spell Choice

You're brave - or perhaps simply reckless - to dare
use magic against the evil Sorcerer. The air vibrates around you
and your hands heat as the spell's essence pulses at fingertips.
It's time to choose the incantation that will decide the duel's outcome.
Weigh the power, cost and risk; each spell has its consequences.

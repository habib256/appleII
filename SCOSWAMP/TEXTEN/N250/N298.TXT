T 298 Flight from the Tower
You hurry to leave the room, you run along the
dark corridor and you pass through the door with the hideous
sculpture. Soon, the evil tower is far behind you. You
have your life, but what have you gained? You've fought
formidable adversaries facing death dozens of
times and all this for what? An evil Sorcerer is an ungrateful
master who's perilous to serve. You can consider
yourself fortunate however to have escaped so easily the clutches of
Stratagus. At least you've rendered a great service to the world
by ridding it of such a harmful mage, but you
promise yourself in the future to show more circumspection in the
choice of masters you'll serve. For now, in any case,
your adventure is over.

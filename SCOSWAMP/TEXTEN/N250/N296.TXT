T 296 Reckless Exploration
You advance bravely into the Scorpion Swamp, but there's
in your attitude a large part of recklessness and, let's say it,
unconsciousness because, although your Copper Ring
guarantees you'll never get lost, you'd need to
resort to many other forms of magic to hope to come out
alive from this exploration. Without magic's help, indeed,
you'll never be able to pierce the Swamp's secrets and after
a few hours of walking, you're already exhausted and bruised
after having had to defend yourself against all sorts of creatures, both
familiar and strange. You soon deem it preferable to
return to the village and you therefore turn back. Test your
Luck.

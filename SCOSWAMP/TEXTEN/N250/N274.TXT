T 274 Sorcerer's Curse
You throw your Curse at the evil Sorcerer, using
one of the Magic Stones he himself gave you. He then
starts screaming while holding his throat with both hands. His own
spell has a radical effect on him since he collapses at your feet and
dies within moments. It's then that you feel on
yourself the consequences of the Curse. Roll a die: the
number obtained represents the number of STAMINA points you've
lost. If you're still alive, you search the
sinister tower hoping to discover its hidden treasures. But
the atmosphere soon becomes heavy and oppressive. As for
your ring, it remains hot warning you that danger still
hangs over you, perhaps even greater danger
than before. Suddenly, you smell sulfur.

C 375 Stay a few minutes in the tower
C 298 Leave immediately

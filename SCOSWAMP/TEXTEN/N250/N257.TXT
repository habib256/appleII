T 257 The Swamp Jump

You prepare to jump over a vast patch of slime.
Roll two dice. If the sum of the numbers obtained is less than
or equal to your SKILL total, you clear the slime without
falling. You gain two LUCK points and continue your
journey without delay, heart light and boots less soiled.
If the sum is greater than your SKILL total, you land
right in the slime mass; the mud holds your steps and you must
free yourself losing time and strength. If you survive,
catch your breath and leave.

C 153 Increase my LUCK by 2 points and continue
C 311 Land in the slime and free myself from the swamp

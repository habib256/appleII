T 250 Flowers Clearing

You find yourself in the clearing where you encountered the
Anguish Flowers. If you killed them all, you can
continue without risk; the clearing is then silent and dry.
If they were still alive when you left, you'll have
to run at full speed to pass without being paralyzed by their
attractive perfume. A rustling rises between the trunks, the
petals shiver - the moment to act has arrived.

C 367 Continue - the flowers are dead, I advance into the clearing
C 269 Flee at full speed - the flowers are alive, I escape quickly

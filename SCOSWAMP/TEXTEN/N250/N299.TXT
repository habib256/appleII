T 299 Terror Stone
You throw your Terror Magic Stone which produces a
stunning result! The Foul Beast, indeed, stops dead then
goes to take refuge on the other side of the clearing hiding behind
rocks and letting out little plaintive moans. If
you want to pursue and fight it, go to 176,
but, beware: your spell's effect will soon dissipate, and
the Beast will then become as formidable as before.

C 176 Pursue and fight it
C 279 Turn back and leave the clearing

T 253 Dwarves' Potion
You drink the potion and immediately experience a strange sensation.
The mixture was intended to "make beautiful" whoever drinks it, but it
was prepared for dwarves. Its effect on you is unusual: for
an hour you're smaller and stockier than usual, and your nose
becomes noticeably larger. After an hour you'll regain
your normal appearance, but you'll have to reduce by 1 point your
SKILL total during the next combat you have to fight.
As soon as this combat ends, your SKILL points return to their initial
level.

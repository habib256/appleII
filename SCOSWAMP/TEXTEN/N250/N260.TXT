T 260 Death Under the Birds

You throw your Curse against the Bird Mistress.
For a moment nothing happens, then her face hardens.
Your Magic Stone transforms her into an evil creature.
The young woman lets out a scream and waves her hand furiously.
Hundreds of birds swoop down on you in a black cloud of beaks.
You suffer their attacks; the world blurs and pain
overwhelms you. A last look toward the Mistress reveals her regret.
The birds move away; it's already too late: you sink.
Your body yields; your strength abandons you; the adventure ends.
END OF ADVENTURE.

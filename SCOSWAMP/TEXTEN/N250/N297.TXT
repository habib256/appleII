T 297 Stratagus's Flying Carpet
While you're running at full speed, you hear a
whistling behind you. You cast a look over your
shoulder: Stratagus pursues you on a flying carpet. You immediately
turn around brandishing your sword, but too late! He's
under the effect of a Strength spell whose secret only he has and he
seizes you by the scruff of the neck then carries you into the air.
You may scream, the flying carpet rises higher and
higher, and, soon, the sorcerer releases you. You fall, you
fall... and everything becomes black... Your adventure is over.

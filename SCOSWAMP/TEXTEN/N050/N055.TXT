T 055 Bear's Den
You approach the hollow log cautiously; a strong odor
emanates: a wild animal has undoubtedly made its den there.
Suddenly, the shaggy head of a gigantic BEAR appears in the opening.
Its heavy breathing makes the wood vibrate; its dark eyes stare at you.
It crawls slightly, ready to pounce on any intruder who approaches.
What do you do?

C 390 Flee immediately
C 200 Fight the Bear with your sword

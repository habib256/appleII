T 087 The Quicksand

You are caught in quicksand and you are sinking
slowly. Your only hope is to get rid of your
armor.

You hurry to remove it and abandon it. You manage to
extract yourself, but you lose 2 SKILL points and must
also reduce your initial SKILL total by 2 points.

You will never be able to recover all your starting
points: such is the price of losing your armor.

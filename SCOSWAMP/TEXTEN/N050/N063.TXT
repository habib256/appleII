T 063 Rejected Magnet
You search through your backpack and offer him the Gold Magnet taken
from the warrior's corpse. He begins to laugh: "Sorry, I don't want it."
"That object is cursed. Throw it in the pond water," he advises you.
You suddenly feel stupid and follow his advice.
Now that the magnet has disappeared, you can offer another object
or try a different strategy.
What do you do?

C 015 Offer another object
C 212 Try another tactic

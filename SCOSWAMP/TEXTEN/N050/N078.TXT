T 078 The Crooked Lance

The "Crooked Lance" is a pleasant and spacious inn.
You give 1 Gold Piece to the innkeeper then go up to your
room. As soon as you put your head on the pillow, you
fall asleep.

In the morning, you feel perfectly rested and regain
2 STAMINA points.

Before your departure, the innkeeper speaks to you: he knows you
have crossed the Scorpion Swamp and suggests visiting
a neighboring sorcerer who sells Magic Stones.

C 150 Go see the sorcerer
C 343 Leave south to cross the Swamp again

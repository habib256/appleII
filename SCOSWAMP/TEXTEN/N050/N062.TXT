T 062 Charge Against the Master
You rush at the Master, sword raised. He leaps back from the
top of his mushroom and makes a quick gesture toward you.
Immediately, his two enormous frogs leap and charge.
The situation becomes dangerous: you are surrounded and must act.
Will you flee by retracing your steps or hold your position?

T 061 The Angry Giant
The Giant cries out, anger twists his features and his voice resounds.
"How dare you? You, the small ones, you steal my belongings
and then you come attack me! Me, I don't want to harm anyone!"
His words sound sincere, but the situation may hide a trick.
Believing his protest allows avoiding bloodshed; continuing the combat
means risking life to try to kill him.
What do you do?

C 229 Believe the Giant and leave in peace
C 366 Continue the fight to try to kill the Giant

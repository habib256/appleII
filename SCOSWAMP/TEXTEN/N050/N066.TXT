T 066 The Suspicious Picnic

You enter a pleasant clearing surrounded by gnarled oaks.
You are in Clearing No. 9. If you've been here before,
go to 192. Otherwise, read what follows.
A small man with a cheerful air is sitting on the ground, back leaning
against the trunk of a tree. He's eating cheese, a picnic
basket open beside him. He doesn't seem armed,
except for a knife he uses to cut his portion.
He notices you and greets you: "Hello, adventurer, would
you like to share my meal?" The Copper Ring diffuses a
warmth around your finger that warns you: don't trust him.
Soon, you understand that he's a THIEF. What do you do?

C 267 Attack the thief immediately
C 017 Pay him no attention and continue
C 147 Accept his invitation and sit beside him

T 084 The Garden Master

There is no doubt that the Garden Master is a friend,
and so you tell him your story with complete confidence.

He wishes you good luck but can hardly help you.
Going around the clearing, you notice that only one
path leads there: the one you took.

You greet the Garden Master and retrace your steps
westward.

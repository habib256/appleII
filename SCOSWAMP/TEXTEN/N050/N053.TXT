T 053 Frog Clearing
Progressing south, the croaking of thousands of frogs
accompanies you. The path leads to a clearing dotted with ponds.
Huge mushrooms stand in the middle; a small man is sitting
on one of them. He is small and corpulent, with black eyes and twitching eyelids.
His mouth is abnormally wide; two enormous frogs guard him.
A silver amulet in the shape of a frog hangs from his neck and glows faintly.
You are in Clearing No. 008.
What do you do?

C 013 Respond with kindness

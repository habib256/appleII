T 058 The Cautious Passage

Test your LUCK. If you are lucky, you reach
the chosen path without harm. If you are unlucky,
your foot catches on a root and you fall, hitting
your leg violently against a stone. This bruise
costs you 1 STAMINA point. You regain your senses,
the pain reminding you that the Swamp spares no one. Despite
everything, you continue. The clearing is before you, and you must
choose a direction. To the west, a dark path. To the east, a
passage bordering tall grass. To the south, the way back.
Your fate is in your hands.

C 398 Take the path heading west
C 105 Follow the grassy path to the east
C 208 Retrace your steps and return south

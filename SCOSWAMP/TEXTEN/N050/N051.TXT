T 051 Flight from the Tower
A trapdoor opens before you, revealing a deep pit.
With a leap you jump over it and cross the hall running at full
speed. A Statue tries to block your way, but you
push it aside with a blow and kick the door open nervously.
The hideous head on the iron panel tries to bite you, in vain.
You dash away from the tower, short of breath, heart pounding.
What do you do?

C 296 Head toward the Swamp
C 005 Run toward the village

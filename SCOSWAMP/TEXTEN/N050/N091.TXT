T 091 The Risky Leap

Roll two dice. If the total is less than or equal to your
STAMINA points, you succeed in crossing the swampy zone
and reach the other side safe and sound. Otherwise, your
leap is too short: your foot sinks into the mud, you
fall heavily and twist your arm. This bad
fall costs you 1 SKILL point. Regaining your senses, you
get up with difficulty. Insects swirl around
you while mud clings to your clothes. Short of breath,
you head toward the exit of the clearing, determined to
continue despite this setback. Three directions then offer themselves to you,
and each leads to the unknown. To the west, a dark path
disappears behind the damp trunks. To the east, a brighter
path seems to snake through tall grass. To the south, the
passage through which you arrived seems less inviting,
but it remains possible to take it again. You weigh
your choices, knowing that each step can have serious consequences.

C 398 Take the path that plunges westward
C 105 Follow the grassy path eastward
C 208 Retrace your steps by the southern path

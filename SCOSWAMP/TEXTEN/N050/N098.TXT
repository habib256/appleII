T 098 Transformation

A harsh blow falls on your skull and you fall at the sorcerer's
feet, your sword slipping from your hands.
Looking up, you think he has grown. But no:
it's you who have shrunk, reduced to the size of an insect.

You flee clumsily on your new legs.
Stratagus laughs loudly and ignores you.
Soon, you climb along a wall to hide in
a crack.

Hunger takes you and you weave a web, hoping to trap
a fly. Your adventurer memories fade, replaced
by the instincts of a field spider.

Your adventure is over.

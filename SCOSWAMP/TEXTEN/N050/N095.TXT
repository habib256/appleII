T 095 The Meeting with Grognard

The villagers shake their heads with a sad air. As you
approach the door, a man suddenly blocks your passage.
Of small stature, middle-aged, he sports a black beard trimmed at
right angles. Without a word, he grabs you by the arm and
leads you to an isolated table. The other customers, indifferent,
resume their conversations. Intrigued, you sit down.
The man introduces himself: "My name is Grognard," he says in a
deep voice. He observes you at length then adds: "If you
really want to face the perils of the Swamp, you need a
goal worthier than drawing a simple map or slaughtering
creatures." His words vibrate with a strange conviction.
Grognard awaits your response in silence. Do you accept his
advice, or do you follow your own path?

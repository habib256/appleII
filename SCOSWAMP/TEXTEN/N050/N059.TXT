T 059 The Corpse and the Pendant

You decide to examine the clearing. Perhaps you'll find
something useful, or someone needs help. Very
quickly, you stumble upon the corpse of a Swamp Orc. You
search the repugnant remains, but nothing interesting comes
of it. Then you notice, leaning against a tree, an injured
man. You approach to help him, but he's already
dead: three arrows have pierced his chest. Two other
Orcs lie at his side. He defended his life dearly.
Around you, neither weapons nor packs: the survivors must have
taken everything. You strive to give the man a
decent burial. As you move him, you notice a small
gold pendant he wears around his neck, in the shape of a magnet. You
can take it if you wish. Once your gestures are complete,
you resume the journey.

C 227 Leave the clearing and resume the journey

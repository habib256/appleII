T 050 Confrontation at the Door
Stratagus listens to your story with manifest interest.
"A magic ring? Really?" he exclaims, eyes wide.
You extend your hand to show him the glowing Copper Ring.
He steps back, makes a strange hand gesture: a spell forms.
The ring heats up intensely; you feel the magic rising.
Act quickly: his pass may be offensive or a test of control.
What do you do?

C 373 Leap and attack Stratagus
C 222 Wait and observe what he will do
C 315 Flee from the tower

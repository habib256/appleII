T 073 The Nest in the Tree

Test your Luck.
If you are Unlucky, you fall and lose 2
STAMINA points, but you nevertheless manage to climb
up to the nest.
If you are Lucky, you reach the nest without difficulty.

You then discover a Gold Chain attached to a branch,
which you can take if you wish.
You climb down immediately after and resume your journey.

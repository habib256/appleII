T 093 The Wolf Master

You cast your Curse on the Wolf Master. He immediately
brings a hand to his throat under the effect of pain. But with
the other hand he draws his sword and points it at you.

It's your turn to feel the effects of your Magic Stone:
roll a die and lose as many STAMINA points as the
number obtained.

If you survive, you must fight the Wolf Master,
but deduct 2 points from his SKILL total and his
STAMINA total.

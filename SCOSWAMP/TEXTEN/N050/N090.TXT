T 090 The Deep River

You have crossed several easily fordable streams, but
the one before you is much deeper.
You are in Clearing No. 34. The river swirls in
eddies and hardly inspires confidence: who knows what creatures
hide in its bed? What will you do faced with this obstacle?

C 370 Use a Magic Ice Stone
C 254 Use a Magic Withering Stone
C 044 Cross the stream on foot with caution

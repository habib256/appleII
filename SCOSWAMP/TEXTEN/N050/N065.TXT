T 065 Brigands Clearing
The path follows a winding trail; you don't stray from it.
You go around a large mushroom where creatures swarm.
Soon, you approach another clearing: voices reach you.
Hidden behind a tree, you spy on a group of five men.
From their attire and language, they are probably BRIGANDS.
The Copper Ring remains cold: they don't seem evil.
It would however be foolish to take unnecessary risks.
You are in Clearing No. 009.
What do you do?

C 137 Retrace your steps along the path taken
C 231 Rush at them shouting and brandishing your sword
C 387 Use magic from your hiding place
C 163 Advance confidently and greet them

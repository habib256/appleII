T 092 The Two Wolves

The path northward gradually rises. The ground becomes drier
and the swamp vegetation gives way to a deep forest.

Soon, the trees thin out and you reach a vast
clearing dotted with bushes: Clearing No. 11.

You listen, but nothing abnormal disturbs the silence.
Then, suddenly, two enormous wolves appear and stare at
you in the shadow.

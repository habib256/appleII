T 056 Pompatarte's House
After a path through fields and winding streets, you arrive at
the threshold of Pompatarte's house. You knock; the Goblin opens the door.
She leads you to the library where Pompatarte is seated, in robes.
"So, how are our affairs going?" he launches immediately.
"Have you brought me a map to reach Courbensaule?"
The question is direct; he awaits a precise answer.

C 158 Yes, I went all the way to Courbensaule
C 008 No, I did not find it

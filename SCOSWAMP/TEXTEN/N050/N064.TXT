T 064 Fire Against the Wolves
You use a Fire Stone: one of the beasts catches fire and the two
wolves flee, panic-stricken. You have gained a precious reprieve.
The Wolf Master is not impressed however.
"Little magic tricks?", he growls, then he brandishes his fist.
A violent pain runs through your arm; you stagger, short of breath.
The wound handicaps your sword hand: you lose striking power.
Immediately, you lose 3 SKILL points and 1 STAMINA point.
Only hand-to-hand combat remains.

WOLF MASTER SKILL: 11 STAMINA: 10

C 314 Flee if you are in a bad position
C 154 Kill the Wolf Master

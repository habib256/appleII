T 060 Illusion Stone
You use an Illusion Stone: you make appear the image
of a defenseless villager fleeing to shelter in the trees.
The FOUL BEAST turns toward this easier prey; you take advantage
to disappear by retracing your steps, along the path by which
you arrived. When the illusion evaporates, the beast remains perplexed.
You have escaped a grave danger; another awaits you however.
What do you do?

T 052 Failure at the Berry
You unfortunately have no berry to give him.
Recounting what happened to you in the Swamp, Gayolard's
face darkens. "I'm sure you did your best,"
he says sadly. At his disappointment, you offer to try again,
but he refuses: "That would be taking too great a risk," he objects.
You did what you could. Alas, it wasn't enough.
Your adventure ends here.

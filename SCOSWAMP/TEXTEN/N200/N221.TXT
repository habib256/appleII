T 221 The Fight Against the Unicorn

You draw your sword and prepare to receive the charge.
UNICORN SKILL: 11 STAMINA: 4
You're lucky: the creature is already seriously wounded.
You'll need to strike at least two Assaults to bring it down.
After these two Assaults, if you wish, you can
flee to save your life. If the Unicorn succumbs to
your blows, you can then collect what must be collected and
continue your journey. In case of combat failure, your adventure
will end here; your body will serve as fertilizer for Swamp plants.
Grit your teeth, strike with precision: even wounded, the beast
remains dangerous and every mistake can be fatal.

C 348 Flee after striking at least two Assaults
C 277 If you kill the Unicorn, continue

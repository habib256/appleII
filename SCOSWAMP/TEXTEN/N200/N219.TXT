T 219 Victory Over the Patroller
Your opponent lies on the ground, struck down after a fierce combat.
Searching the body, you find a sharp dagger, provisions,
and a solid helmet. Putting it on, you gain +1 in SKILL.
Invigorated, you resume your march toward new dangers.

C 234 Leave the place and resume the journey

T 240 Grognard's Proposal

You approve Grognard's words. The idea of a specific
mission would make your journey more interesting. He nods,
satisfied, then continues: "There are three men in this village.
None can enter the Swamp themselves, but each
seeks an adventurer bold enough to risk it." You
perceive in his eyes a gleam of mischief. The first, he says,
is an old sorcerer who has always devoted himself to Good.
Grognard pauses and drinks a gulp from his tankard,
letting a thick silence hang. You feel the moment is
important: accept to listen or declare your position.
Grognard stares at you without blinking, awaiting your decision.
Will you agree to know more about the others, or
proclaim your loyalty to Good without further delay?

C 205 Want to know more and listen to Grognard attentively
C 155 Declare you will serve only the cause of Good

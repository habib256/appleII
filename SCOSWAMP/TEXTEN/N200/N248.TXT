T 248 Eagle's Journey
The Bird Mistress calls an immense Eagle that descends from the sky.
It seizes you by the waist and carries you above the clearings.
Below, the Croupie River shines and crocodiles bask.
The Eagle deposits you next to a tree whose gigantic nest
is built of branches. It leaves you on the ground then departs.
You are in Clearing No. 016.
What do you do?

C 202 Follow the trail toward the Eagle's nest

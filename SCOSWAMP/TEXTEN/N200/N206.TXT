T 206 Stratagus's Mission

The sorcerer Stratagus welcomes you in a room with shelves loaded
with grimoires and vials. On the wall, a living mirror shows changing
scenes. In a grave voice, he speaks of new sorcerers settled
in the Scorpion Swamp. Some control wolves, others
plants. All draw their power from Silver Amulets they wear around their necks.

"I want these amulets," he says. "At least three. I don't care how
you obtain them. I'll give you five hundred gold pieces for each."

He laughs when asked for protection: "I can almost make you
a sorcerer. Take six Magic Stones, but not those of Good."

You feel the Swamp will be less dangerous than this gloomy tower.
Your mission begins: bring back to Stratagus the Masters' Amulets.

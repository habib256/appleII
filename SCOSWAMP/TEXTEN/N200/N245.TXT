T 245 Discreet Theft
You use an Illusion Stone and take the appearance of a frog.
Discreet, you slip among the others and sneak behind
the mushroom on which the Master sits. With a precise movement,
you slide the chain and the Amulet falls into your paw.
The Master tumbles into the pond, croaks and has a mouth full of water.
Taking advantage of the disorder, you regain the trail and leave the clearing.

C 352 Reach the trail and flee

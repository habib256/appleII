T 208 Leaving the Swamp

The brightness seems to grow as you progress. Suddenly,
you see a patch of blue sky through a gap in the
foliage, just above your head. A few minutes
later, the trees part at the path's end and you understand
you've left the Swamp. The air is drier, the light more
pure, and your steps become less heavy. Yet, a question
arises: is your mission accomplished? If you haven't
yet completed your task, it's still possible to
turn back. You can then retrace your steps,
following this path in the other direction until you find
a clearing. The Swamp, with its traps and mysteries, remains there,
behind you, ready to swallow again the imprudent traveler.
But if, on the contrary, you deem your quest accomplished, it's
time to consider returning to your sorcerer, to
report the fruit of your research. The choice is yours,
between continuing the adventure or returning crowned with glory.

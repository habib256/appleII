T 241 Stratagus's Magic Sword
Stratagus congratulates you for your courage and hands you a gift.
He pulls out a miniature sword that grows before you and becomes a
Magic Sword. When employed, it adds +1 point
to your SKILL total for the corresponding combat action.
Then Stratagus touches your shoulder with his Wand: your LUCK
immediately returns to its initial level if you had lost any.
You feel the weapon's power and the magic protecting you somewhat.
Do you accept the gift and continue with him?

C 206 Accept the sword and continue with Stratagus

T 212 The Frog Master

The Sorcerer looks at you warily.
"Ah, the Asphodel... I know it," he says. "But I'm only a
neutral sorcerer, and these bushes have no power for me. Why therefore
should I help you?"

His voice is soft, but his gaze, cold as swamp slime.
Around him, his giant frogs croak, ready to leap.
He awaits your answer, fingers placed on his silver amulet.

T 218 Will-o'-the-Wisp at the Edge
The path widens and opens onto a calm clearing.
A faint glow floats westward: a WILL-O'-THE-WISP dances in the air.
It retreats a few meters, revealing a muddy and overgrown path.
Elsewhere, trails lead south and east under the trees.
You are in Clearing No. 015.
Do you follow it or ignore it?

C 072 Follow the Will-o'-the-Wisp westward
C 336 Ignore it and go south
C 121 Ignore it and take the eastern road

T 216 Too Many Scorpions
They are far too numerous to be fought one by one.
Already they climb on your boots and along your legs.
Their stingers sting you: roll 1 die and lose as much STAMINA.
Furious, you leap over the melee and rush out of the zone.

C 319 Leave the clearing by leaping over the scorpions

T 201 The Birds' Cry
You throw a Terror Stone toward the Bird Mistress.
She lets out a scream of horror, but immediately, the sky
darkens: hundreds of shimmering birds swoop down on you.
They don't attack you, they protect her. Their wings beat
around you, completely blinding you.
When finally the tumult ceases, the Mistress has disappeared.

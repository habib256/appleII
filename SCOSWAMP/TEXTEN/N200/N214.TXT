T 214 The Friendly Brigands

The Brigands, now smiling, agree to chat with you.
One of them, a tall bearded man, indicates the northern direction.
"The town of Courbensaule isn't very far now," he says. "And if you want
to rest, look for the Twisted Lance inn. The owner is honest,
which is rare around here."

You thank them warmly and resume your journey,
your heart light, heading north.

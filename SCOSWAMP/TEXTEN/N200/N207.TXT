T 207 The Sorcerer's Payment

Stratagus frowns and an evil smile lights up his face.
"Insolent... but clever!" he says, opening a leather purse.
Under your wary gaze, he slowly counts five hundred gold pieces
for each amulet you handed him. The metal's tinkling
fills the room, mixture of promise and threat.

When he's finished, he pushes the bag toward you with a sharp gesture.
His gaze glows with a strange flame, and you feel you shouldn't
delay leaving this cursed place.

T 225 Stratagus's Anger
Stratagus straightens up, eyes black with fury. With a quick
movement, he pulls from his robe an ebony wand that transforms
into a serrated, glowing sword. His snapping voice threatens you:
"I'm going to kill you!" The assault is inevitable; you must engage
combat without delay.

STRATAGUS SKILL: 9 STAMINA: 10

T 204 The Anguish Flowers
The path widens, and colorful flowers border the way.
This is Clearing No. 23.
But suddenly, a shiver runs through you: something's wrong.
Your Copper Ring becomes burning, sign of nearby danger.

Around you, these flowers seem too beautiful...
You then remember their dreaded name:
the **Anguish Flowers**!
Their pollen inspires terror and you feel your hands trembling.
You lose 1 SKILL point.

What do you do?

C 269 Flee straight ahead
C 032 Slash them with sword blows
C 080 Attempt a magic spell

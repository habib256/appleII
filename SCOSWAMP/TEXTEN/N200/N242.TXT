T 242 Light Bag

Opening the bag you notice it isn't as heavy
as it should be. You crossed the Swamp for him;
and here upon returning, the contents are missing. Stratagus has
deceived you, or there's been an error: anger rises.
What do you do? Return to the tower and strike him? Try the
magical way to recover what's due you? Or resign yourself
and leave with what you've been given to avoid further perils?

C 124 Return to the tower and attack him
C 256 Return but resort to magic
C 358 Resign yourself and leave with the payment

T 210 Return to the Cursed Clearing

You find again the clearing where the Foul Beast had attacked you.
The ground still bears traces of combat, covered with scratches and
disturbed earth. A heavy silence weighs between the trees, as if the place
holds its breath, awaiting your decision.

C 243 If the creature is dead and the place is safe
C 143 If the Foul Beast still lives in the clearing

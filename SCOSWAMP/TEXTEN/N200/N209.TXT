T 209 Basin Beast
You walk eastward and discover a clearing with a basin.
An enormous creature with brown rubbery skin suddenly emerges
from the basin and attempts to seize you with a tentacle.
You leap backward: the BASIN BEAST advances toward you.
A magnificent Purple Jewel shines on its forehead, attracting the eye.
The basin water stirs; ripples betray the beast's power.
You are in Clearing No. 025.
What do you do?

C 397 Flee
C 082 Attack with your sword
C 034 Resort to magic

T 226 At the Tower Door
You find Stratagus's tower again, its heavy door opens and
the sorcerer awaits you, impatient. He extends his hand asking
for the Amulets: his voice is greedy. He awaits a concrete answer.
What do you tell him according to what you've brought back?

C 054 I didn't manage to obtain any Amulets
C 007 I bring back one or two
C 194 I bring back three or more

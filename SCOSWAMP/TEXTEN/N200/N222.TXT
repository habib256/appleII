T 222 Stratagus's Demon
An enormous horned demon surges between you and the sorcerer. Green fur,
repulsive warts, gnarled hands like roots. Stratagus
points a dry finger: "Kill this fool and bring me his ring."
You've been reckless; you must pay the price.

DEMON - SKILL: 12 STAMINA: 16

Impossible to flee: it would catch you. It has no weapon, only
its monstrous fists: a chance remains to defeat it.

C 174 If you manage to kill it

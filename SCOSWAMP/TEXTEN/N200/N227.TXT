T 227 The Choice of Paths

Three paths allow you to leave the clearing. The one leading
eastward seems narrower and darker than the others.
The northern trail rises slightly and promises more
dry air; the western one seems to return to places already seen.
Silence weighs, only broken by the buzzing of flies.
In which direction do you wish to go?

C 066 Take the trail rising northward
C 388 Take the narrow passage eastward
C 320 Take the path returning westward

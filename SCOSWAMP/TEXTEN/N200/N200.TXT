T 200 Challenge to the Bear
You have killed an impressive number of monsters and beasts.
A bear therefore doesn't scare you: you let out a defiant cry
and brandish your sword, ready for combat.
The bear is massive, its claws would lacerate fragile armor.
BEAR SKILL: 7 STAMINA: 8

If you feel you're getting the worse of it, Flee.

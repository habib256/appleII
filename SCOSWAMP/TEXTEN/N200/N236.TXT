T 236 The Innkeeper's Chair
Exhausted by the long journey, you rush down the stairs.
Brandishing your sword, you threaten the joyful revelers gathered.
They respond with bursts of laughter that fill the room.
The innkeeper seizes a chair and strikes your arm with a great blow.
Your sword falls to the ground; your arm is bruised.
You lose 2 SKILL points.
It's vain to fight all these men: you return to your room.

C 116 Return to your room

T 211 The Flaming Beard

A crazy idea crosses your mind: set the Giant's beard on fire.
You throw your Fire Stone, and immediately his long gray beard
ignites in a dry crackling. The colossus screams, beating his
hands on his smoking chin until extinguishing the flames.

His roar makes the clearing tremble. Your spell has diminished his
strength, but his fury is terrible and he blocks all retreat.
Confrontation is inevitable.

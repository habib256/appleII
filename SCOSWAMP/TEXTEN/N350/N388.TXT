T 388 Pincer Grass

Soon, you enter a pleasant grass-covered clearing.
Two paths allow you to go further. This is Clearing
No. 24. If you've been there before, go to 263. Otherwise, read
what follows. You remain motionless for a moment, casting a glance
around you. You then realize this grass has
something strange. It indeed grows so fast you can
see it move. And while you observe it, pincers
appear at its stems' ends, pincers trying
to grab you. You're right in the middle of an
expanse of PINCER GRASS!

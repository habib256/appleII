T 395 The Black Bear

You decide to spend the night at the nearest inn:
"The Black Bear". On the ground floor, the room is packed with customers
apparently determined to party, but you pay them
no attention and go up to your room after
paying 1 Gold Piece to the innkeeper. Unfortunately, there's so much
noise downstairs you can't close your eyes. The revelers
thus make you lose 1 STAMINA point. What will you do
now?

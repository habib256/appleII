T 364 Attack at the Basin

You're again in the clearing where you drank
from a basin water that relieved your wounds. You
approach this beneficial water, but, a moment later,
an arrow whistles past your ears, then another. It's
impossible for you to determine where they're fired from and you
Flee by the path you took to
get here.

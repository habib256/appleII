T 375 Tower Explosion

You pay no attention to the sulfur smell and
search the tower humming a cheerful tune, while stuffing
your Backpack with books and golden statuettes. But,
suddenly, you hear a hissing: you turn around and
find yourself then face to face with a large black form.
Two small almond-shaped eyes look at you in the darkness
projecting a sparkling glow. "Thank you, poor mortal," says the
voice in a hiss. "I've long waited to come
seize his soul. It's mine now." You immediately
flee while the shadow hovers over
Stratagus's corpse but you won't have time to
escape. Indeed, you haven't yet reached the
entrance door when the sulfur smell becomes unbearable. The tower
entirely then ignites and explodes. Thus ends
your adventure.

T 369 Another Ice Stone

You realize that, even with another Ice
Stone, you won't manage to sufficiently strengthen the
bridge; you therefore throw the Stone at your feet to form a large
piece of ice on which you can drift along the
river, eastward. On both sides, the banks are
covered with thick vegetation. Suddenly, you see at
some distance ahead of you an old stone bridge of impressive
size.

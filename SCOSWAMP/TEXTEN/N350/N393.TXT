T 393 Withering Stone

You're convinced the Withering Magic Stone
suits perfectly in this kind of situation and you immediately throw it
at the Sword Trees. To your great relief, you then
see them take on a yellowish tint then wither before
your eyes. You then cast a look around you, but you
find nothing interesting apart from a few seeds doubtless
from these Sword Trees. You
decide to pick them up thinking they might be useful
later and you set off again.

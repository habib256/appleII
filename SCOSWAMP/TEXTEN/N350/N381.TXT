T 381 Unicorn's Blessing

You don't want to attack the wounded Unicorn for you've
always heard they're benevolent creatures.
You therefore throw a Blessing Magic Stone at it and
see it shudder when the spell reaches it. It immediately
starts neighing joyfully. The wounds on its flank are
almost healed now and it seems much more
vigorous. It remains however wary, not daring to
approach a human being, but it digs the ground with its
horn at the clearing's other end then casts you a look and
leaves. You then go see the place where it dug and
discover there two Magic Stones similar to those
Gayolard gave you. One is a Friendship Stone, the Other
a LUCK Stone. You thank the Unicorn being sure
it heard you wherever it is, and you continue your
journey.

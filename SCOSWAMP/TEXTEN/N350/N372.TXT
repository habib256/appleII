T 372 Guards Arrive

You hear shouts rising from the ground floor. The
Goblin maid calls for help: "Soldiers! Quick! Help!
He's killing my master!" she screams. While
you wonder if it wouldn't be better to flee, the
door suddenly bursts open behind Pompatarte, and three
guards dressed in red mail coats rush inside the
room pointing their crossbows at your chest. Without
waiting for orders and without warning, they immediately fire and the
arrows pierce your body. You collapse on the floor,
killed instantly. Thus ends your adventure.

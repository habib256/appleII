T 357 The Cursed Magnet

The two other arrows also miss their mark but,
suddenly, they change direction mid-course and come
strike you in the chest. You immediately lose 5
STAMINA points; if you're still alive, you realize
the Gold Magnet found on the warrior's body is actually a
cursed object. It attracts arrows, indeed, and almost killed you
after causing the death of whoever wore it before you. The
Orcs are preparing new arrows. What will
you do?

C 281 Attack them with your sword

T 398 The Wolf Master's Clearing

You enter a clearing where a small log house has been built.
This is Clearing No. 4. If you've been there before, go
to 239. Otherwise, read what follows. You then hear a
growl resembling a dog's: it's not a
dog, however, but a Wolf growling thus. The animal observes you,
standing next to the house. The door opens almost
immediately, and a robust man appears on the threshold. Another
Wolf follows him. The man wears a sword at his side and is dressed
like a Forest Ranger, but the Silver wolf-shaped Amulet
hanging on his chest indicates this is the
WOLF MASTER. You greet him in a friendly tone but he
answers you with bad humor ordering you to go
your way. What will you do?

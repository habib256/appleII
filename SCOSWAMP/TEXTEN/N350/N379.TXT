T 379 Garden Master's Attack

You draw your sword and try to strike him with it,
but he steps back and you miss him. "Why
are you attacking me?" he exclaims, astonished. He immediately flees and,
having no armor, manages to run faster than you.
Then picking up a sickle, he takes a defensive stance at the clearing's other end.
When you arrive near him, he makes a hand
gesture to cast a spell on you and you lose 3 SKILL points.
GARDEN MASTER SKILL: 7 STAMINA: 10

C 363 Flee
C 251 If you kill the Garden Master

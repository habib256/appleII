T 351 Illusion Spell

You hesitate to use against Stratagus one of his own
Magic Stones: that could be dangerous for you. You
throw instead an Illusion spell or, at least, you
try, for the sorcerer makes a hand gesture and the image you
wanted to create dissipates before even being able to take form. "
You won't succeed in deceiving me with these childish tricks!
Stratagus exclaims contemptuously. Prepare yourself rather to die,
poor fool!"

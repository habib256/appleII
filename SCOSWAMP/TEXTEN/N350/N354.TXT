T 354 Incendiary Amulet

You pull your sword from your repugnant opponent's corpse
with a sigh of relief. But, all around
you, the Spiders watch you and approach closer and
closer. You then bend over their deceased Master's body
to seize his spider-shaped Amulet. But
when you remove it from his neck, a spark suddenly bursts and the
corpse instantly catches fire. You hasten to leave the
clearing taking the Amulet while flames
spread behind you. The fire will quickly burn the
spiders, but you must hurry to get to 165 if
you don't want to be carbonized in turn!

C 165 Leave immediately

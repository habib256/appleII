T 396 The Antherique Bush

"Could it be possible?" exclaims the Garden Master. "An
Antherique bush somewhere in this Swamp? I knew
this place must harbor some hidden virtue when
I decided to settle here. That's doubtless what I
sensed!" He remains motionless for a moment with lowered eyelids
and seems to reflect then opens his eyes again. "The plant
you're looking for," he then says, "is to the east, but no
path allows reaching it directly. To find it,
you must head west, then return east
clockwise." He then
wishes you good luck and gives you a Beneficial Magic Stone
(choose which one). You now resume your
journey. Only one path allows leaving the clearing so you
take it, walking west.

T 373 Surprise Attack

Test your Luck. If you're Lucky, your attack is so
lightning-fast you manage to wound the sorcerer. Then go
to 225, but you'll subtract 2 points from the total STAMINA of
your opponent before combat engages. If you're
Unlucky, you don't manage to hit him; in that case,
you'll also go to 225 to fight him, but
without changing this time the total STAMINA he has.

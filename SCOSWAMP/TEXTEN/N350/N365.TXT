T 365 Returned Spell

You think a Terror spell will give you the
best chance of defeating Stratagus and you therefore throw
your Magic Stone at him. Alas! he makes a hand gesture and it's
you who then suffers the spell's effects.
An icy sensation immediately invades you: you're afraid,
terribly afraid, and you lose one SKILL point.

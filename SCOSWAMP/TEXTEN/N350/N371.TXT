T 371 The Antherique Quest

"You're the one I was waiting for," says Gayolard. "I'll
entrust you with a quest. There exists a rare plant, the Antherique, with
curative properties precious for White Magic. The forces
of Evil have almost entirely destroyed it. Thanks to my crystal
ball, I've discovered a last bush survives in the
Scorpion Swamp. It's small, dark green, with white
flowers and purple berries. Bring me back a single berry and
I can revive this plant throughout the world.

In the Swamp reign magical forces against which
a sword isn't enough. I'm giving you six Magic Stones.
Choose them from the list (Beneficial or Neutral Stones
only, no Malefic Stones). Write them down on your
Adventure Sheet. Once all used, you can
only count on your sword and intelligence.

You put the Stones in your purse and take leave.
Your mission: find an Antherique berry and bring it back."

T 361 Spider Master's Trap

You throw your Friendship Magic Stone. For a moment,
the Spider Master seems disconcerted, then he starts
smiling. "Ah, very good, I see you come as a friend," he says.
You return his smile and start telling him about
your mission. But, at that moment, you feel a sharp
pain in your neck. The Master then bursts into joyous laughter. You
immediately turn around and find yourself before a
large black spider dangling from a thread attached to
a branch. Its venom quickly spreads in your blood
and you collapse on the ground, unable to move. In a
semi-fog, you see the Spider Master
searching your Backpack to examine the loot he's just
appropriated. Then you feel yourself being lifted from behind and
hoisted onto a tree branch. A few moments
later, you find yourself wrapped in a spider web,
and you remain there, suspended between heaven and earth. In a week
or two, the Spiders living in these places will doubtless
judge your carcass ripe and will offer themselves
at your expense a delectable meal. You'll have understood, of course, that your adventure is
over.

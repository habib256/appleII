T 359 Lie to the Frog Master

You're convinced the Frog Master would show
much less friendliness if he knew the exact nature of your
mission and you therefore invent a lie. "I'm in Sukumvit's service,
Baron of Fang," you claim. "He sent me to
explore the Scorpion Swamp to find new
monsters he could populate his famous Deathtrap
Dungeon with. When I arrived at the village near
the Swamp, I heard of the Masters who've taken up residence
there and I promised myself to learn more about them. Who
are you therefore and why have you come to settle here?"
Test your Luck.

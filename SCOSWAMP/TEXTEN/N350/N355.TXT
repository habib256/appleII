T 355 Return to Courbensaule

The path leading to Courbensaule is now familiar to you,
but when you enter the town again, something
seems to have changed. You indeed feel people
looking at you and murmurs rising as you pass. You
then understand the rumor of your exploits has spread
around and they're now publicly known. You
feel a certain unease being thus observed and, as
you engage in a side street, you have
the impression of being followed. You immediately turn around to find
yourself face to face with two ragged CUTPURSES.
They attack you immediately,
convinced you must have brought back a fabulous treasure from your wanderings
in the Swamp. You can't flee and you don't
have enough time to resort to magic. All that's left
is to fight them.

SKILL STAMINA
First CUTPURSE 7 5
Second CUTPURSE 8 5

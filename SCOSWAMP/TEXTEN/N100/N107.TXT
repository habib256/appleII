T 107 The Brigands' Curse

You cast your curse on the nearest brigand.
He screams and collapses immediately. His companions rush over,
then frightened, flee northward.

The brigand on the ground is dead, features convulsed, struck
by a dreadful evil.

But soon, you yourself feel the backlash:
roll a die and lose as many STAMINA points as
the number rolled.

If you survive, you can continue your journey.

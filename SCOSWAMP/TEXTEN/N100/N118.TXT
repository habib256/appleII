T 118 The Scorpion Clearing

Some distance away, two paths join the one you
are following. The crossing occurs in a small clearing: No. 13.

If you've been here before, ignore this passage.

Your Copper Ring tingles on your finger. Looking down,
you see dozens of small scorpions rushing toward you.

Test your Luck.

C 070 If you are Lucky
C 182 If you are Unlucky

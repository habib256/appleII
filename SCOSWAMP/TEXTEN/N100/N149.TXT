T 149 The Bird Clearing

You enter a clearing invaded by brightly colored birds.
There is no trace of a human presence; the Bird Mistress must have
been absent.
You search the clearing for clues.
All you find are scattered feathers, littering the ground.
A light silence floats, as if the branches were holding their breath.

C 217 You decide to continue your journey.

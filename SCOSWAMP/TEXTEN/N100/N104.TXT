T 104 The Frog Master

The Frog Master jumps from his mushroom and gathers
water in his hand, shaping it into a crystal ball.
He plunges his gaze into the sphere and murmurs a few words,
then throws it into the pond.

He turns to you:
"The plant you seek is to the north, but the path is
winding and dangerous. Beware of the other Masters for
not all are benevolent. And be kind to the Giant."

With these words, he leaps and disappears into the trees.
The clearing is now empty.

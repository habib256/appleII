T 146 Frog Combat

Two enormous frogs attack you at the same time.
To your great surprise, their jaws are bristling with teeth.
SKILL STAMINA
First GIANT FROG 5 6
Second GIANT FROG 6 5
Each frog will fight you in turn at each assault.
Before each assault, you will choose which one to face as a priority.
If your Attack Strength exceeds that of the chosen adversary,
you will inflict no injury on the other: you will have dodged it.
If, on the contrary, the second has superior Strength, you will suffer
an injury according to the usual rules.
If you kill one of the two frogs, the combat continues
against the other according to normal rules.

C 230 If you are victorious, continue your adventure.

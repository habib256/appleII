T 143 The Beast Returns
Barely entered the clearing, an atrocious growl resounds.
The FOUL BEAST didn't succeed in devouring you the first time;
it wants to try again and throws itself at you, drooling pincers.
You weigh your options: resort to Magic Stones as before,
or hold firm and face it with your sword, without artifice.

C 374 Use Magic Stones against the beast
C 176 Fight the beast hand-to-hand

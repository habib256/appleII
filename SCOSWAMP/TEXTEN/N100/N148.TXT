T 148 The Fat Pig

You wonder what kind of illusion could deceive
the Brigands; they look ragged and hungry.
Doubtless they would be delighted with a good meal.
You sketch a smile: a good idea comes to you.
You create the illusion of a fat pig crossing the clearing,
then running along a path leading there.
In their haste to capture this unhoped-for prey, the Brigands
jostle each other and rush in pursuit without seeing you.
You take advantage of their disorder and cross the clearing.

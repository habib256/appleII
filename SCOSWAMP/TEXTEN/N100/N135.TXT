T 135 Orc Loot

You search the corpses of the Swamp Orcs.
Their weapons are mediocre, their food repugnant.

One of them has some Gold Pieces.
Roll a die to know the number.

The other carries a crude map. You find your
position on it, but nothing new... except a drawing:
a crowned frog, all the way south on the map.

C 309 Go toward the crowned frog

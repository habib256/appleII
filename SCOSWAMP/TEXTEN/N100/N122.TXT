T 122 Warning

The man tries to convince you seriously.

"It's more interesting to have a mission to fulfill. And above all,

You are doubtless valiant, perhaps even a bit of a mage,
but without the help of an experienced sorcerer, you risk greatly
never seeing the sun again."

His words seem sincere.

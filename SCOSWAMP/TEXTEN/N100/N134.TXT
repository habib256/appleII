T 134 Combat against the Grass
You strike the PINCER GRASS with great sword blows and cut it.
It however constantly regrows and ends up surrounding you.
You must fight this vegetation as if it formed a single
adversary, implacable and infinite.
The shock is brutal; keep your breath and your composure.

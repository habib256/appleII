T 141 The Warrior's Rest

The offer seems reasonable to you. You hand over your unused
Magic Stones to Pompatarte.

His servant brings a potion.
You swallow it, and your wounds heal immediately.

Your adventure is over.
But if you have failed, you have also learned,
and perhaps you will return one day to explore the Swamp.

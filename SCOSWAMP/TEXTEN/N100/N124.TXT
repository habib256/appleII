T 124 The Final Duel

The evil sorcerer, mad with rage, draws from his robe a wand
that suddenly shines and transforms into a serrated blade.

He takes his guard. The weapon sparkles: it is clearly magical.
This combat will be the last of your adventure.

STRATAGUS
SKILL: 13
STAMINA: 18

It's a duel to the death. You cannot flee.

T 131 The Bird Mistress

The Parrot stares at you with a round eye.
"Come closer," it says, "she knows you're coming."

You pass through a curtain of palm trees and discover a
splendid clearing, populated by thousands of birds with
shimmering feathers. Eagles and Herons walk freely.

In the center, a magnificent woman sits on a pedestal.
It's the Bird Mistress. She greets you and calls you
by your name. "Which sorcerer do you serve?" she asks.

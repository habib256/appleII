T 113 The Spider Blaze

The idea comes to you that spider webs burn wonderfully.
You throw a Fire Stone at the Spider Master: his
clothes immediately catch fire.

He collapses screaming, and the fire races across the entire clearing.
Curtains of flames rise and reduce to ashes
the repugnant creature lurking in these places.

The heat is so intense that you give up searching.
You flee this blaze, not without suffering burns that
cost you 3 STAMINA points.

C 165 Leave the clearing hastily

T 103 The Giant

You explain to the Giant the purpose of your mission.
He nods and gives you some information:

"Here we are near the northern edge of the Swamp," he says,
"and the town of Courbensaule is very far to the west.
You should therefore take that direction."

You thank him then resume your journey.

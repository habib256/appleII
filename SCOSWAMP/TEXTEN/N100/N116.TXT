T 116 Restless Night

You try to ignore the racket rising from the ground floor,
but the laughter and songs become deafening.
You don't find sleep until well after midnight.

At dawn, the tumult of the market below your windows wakes you.
Furious, you gather your belongings and leave the town, taking
the southern direction toward the Swamp.

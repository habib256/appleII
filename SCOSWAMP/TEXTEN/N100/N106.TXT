T 106 The Thief's Trap

A cord wraps around your neck: the Thief has
tricked you! Fortunately, you are much stronger than him and
force him to let go before flipping him
over your shoulder. You are now free, short of breath.
The struggle has cost you 2 STAMINA points. The Thief has drawn
a dagger and threatens you with a quick gesture. He's ready to
fight to the end. What do you do?

C 267 Attack the Thief and finish it
C 179 Flee immediately

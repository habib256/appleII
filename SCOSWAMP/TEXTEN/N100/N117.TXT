T 117 The Garden Amulet

You throw the Friendship Stone at the Garden Master.
He smiles widely: "What can I do for you, dear friend?"

You ask for his Flower Amulet. He places it around your neck,
but as soon as it touches you, you are paralyzed.
The Garden Master stares at you and orders you to tell the truth.
Despite yourself, you obey.

"You are not evil," he says, "but you serve a
despicable master. Take care."

He takes back his Amulet and leaves. Gradually, you regain
your strength and resume the journey westward.

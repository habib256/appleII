T 144 The Spider Tent
The path is invaded by spider webs hanging from branches.
A little further you make out a clearing studded with webs.
Thousands of threads form garlands between the trees.
Everywhere, spiders abound and carpet the surrounding foliage.
In the center, a sumptuous tent seems to float above the swamp.
A tall man sits inside: beard and eyebrows
snow white; his silver robe blends with the tent.
A Silver Amulet in the shape of a spider shines on his neck.
The Copper Ring warms around your finger: an evil sign.
You are in Clearing No. 017.
What do you want to do?

C 074 Resort to magic
C 026 Attack without waiting
C 332 Speak to the man in a friendly tone

T 123 Magical Interruption

The sorcerer opens wide eyes and leaps backward.
In his momentum, he loses his hat and knocks over a vase
that shatters on the ground.

A pestilential vapor escapes from it and the animated statue
immediately freezes.

You have broken his concentration and neutralized his spell.

C 225 Continue your attack
C 315 Take advantage of the hesitation to flee

T 147 The Thief's Picnic

You sit down opposite him. "What do you do for
a living?" you ask him. "I rob travelers,"
he replies without being troubled. "When someone passes by this
path, my nets fall and capture them; after, I help myself."
He points at the foliage. Your gaze follows the direction
he shows and you barely distinguish, hidden among the
branches, fine cords ready to tighten. The thief smiles and
seems to wait for you to make the first move. Test
your LUCK: if fate favors you, you will avoid the trap;
otherwise, you will fall into the net and will have to
free yourself by force.

C 213 You are LUCKY - you avoid the trap and discover a clue
C 267 You are UNLUCKY - you fall into his net and must react
